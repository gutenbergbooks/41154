<p class="chap">ON THE ST. ETIENNE HOTEL</p>

<div class="drop">
<img src="images/idct.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">The St. Etienne Hotel would some day be
as bulky and as garishly magnificent as
four million dollars could make it. Now
it was only a steel framework rearing
itself into the center of the overhead grayness&mdash;a
black pier supporting the grimy arch of
heaven.</p></div>

<p>Up on its loosely-planked twenty-first story stood
Mr. Driscoll, watching his men at work. A raw
February wind scraped slowly under the dirty clouds,
which soiled the whole sky, and with a leisurely content
thrust itself into his office-tendered flesh. He
shivered, and at times, to throw off the chill, he
paced across the pine boards, carefully going around
the gaps his men were wont to leap. And now and
then his eyes wandered from his lofty platform. On
his right, below, there were roofs; beyond, a dull
bar of water; beyond, more roofs: on his left there
were roofs; a dull bar of water; more roofs: and all
around the jagged wilderness of house-tops reached
away and away till it faded into the complete envelopment
of a smudgy haze. Once Mr. Driscoll
caught hold of the head of a column and leaned out
above the street; over its dizzy bottom erratically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
shifted dark specks&mdash;hats. He drew back with a
shiver with which the February wind had nothing
to do.</p>

<p>It was a principle with Mr. Driscoll, of Driscoll
&amp; Co., contractors for steel bridges and steel frames
of buildings, that you should not show approval of
your workmen's work. "Give 'em a smile and
they'll do ten per cent. less and ask ten per cent.
more." So as he now watched his men, one hand
in his overcoat pocket, one on his soft felt hat, he did
not smile. It was singularly easy for him not to
smile. Balanced on his short, round body he had
a round head with a rim of reddish-gray hair, and
with a purplish face that had protruding lips which
sagged at each corner, and protruding eyes whose
lids blinked so sharply you seemed to hear their
click. So much nature had done to help him adhere
to his principle. And he, in turn, had added to
his natural endowment by growing mutton-chops.
Long ago someone had probably expressed to him a
detestation of side-whiskers, and he of course had
begun forthwith to shave only his chin.</p>

<p>His men were setting twenty-five foot steel columns
into place,&mdash;the gang his eyes were now on, moving
actively about a great crane, and the gang about the
great crane at the building's other end. Their coats
were buttoned to their chins to keep out the February
wind; their hands were in big, shiny gloves; their blue
and brown overalls, from the handling of painted
iron, had the surface and polish of leather. They
were all in the freshness of their manhood&mdash;lean, and
keen, and full of spirit&mdash;vividly fit. Their work ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>plained
their fitness; it was a natural civil service
examination that barred all but the active and the
daring.</p>

<p>And yet, though he did not smile, Mr. Driscoll
was cuddled by satisfaction as he stood on the great
platform just under the sky and watched the brown
men at work. He had had a deal of trouble during
the past three years&mdash;accidents, poor workmen, delays
due to strikes over inconsequential matters&mdash;all
of which had severely taxed his profits and his profanity.
So the smoothness with which this, his
greatest job, progressed was his especial joy. In
his heart he credited this smoothness to the brown
young foreman who had just come back to his side&mdash;but
he didn't tell Keating so.</p>

<p>"The riveters are keeping right on our heels,"
said Tom. "Would you like to go down and have
a look at 'em?"</p>

<p>"No," said Mr. Driscoll shortly.</p>

<p>The foreman shrugged his shoulders slightly, and
joined the gang Mr. Driscoll was watching. In the
year he had worked for Mr. Driscoll he had learned
to be philosophic over that gentleman's gruffness:
he didn't like the man, so why should he mind his
words?</p>

<p>The men had fastened a sling about a twenty-five
foot column and to this had attached the hook
of the pulley. The seventy-foot arm of the crane
now slowly rose and drew after it the column, dangling
vertically. Directed by the signals of Tom's
right hand the column sank with precision to its appointed
place at one corner of the building. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
quickly fastened to the head of the column beneath
it with four bolts. Later the riveters, whose hammers
were now maintaining a terrific rattle two floors
below, would replace the four bolts by four rows of
rivets.</p>

<p>"Get the sling, Pete," ordered Tom.</p>

<p>At this a loosely-jointed man threw off his slouch
hat, encircled the column with his arms, and mounted
with little springs. Near its top he locked his legs
around the column, and, thus supported and working
with both hands, he unfastened the rope from the
pulley hook and the column, and threw it below. He
then stepped into the hook of the pulley, swung
through the air to the flooring, picked up his hat
and slapped it against his leg.</p>

<p>Sometimes Mr. Driscoll forgot his principle.
While Pete was nonchalantly loosening the sling,
leaning out over the street, nothing between him and
the pavement but the grip of his legs, there was something
very like a look of admiration in Mr. Driscoll's
aggravating eyes. He moved over to Pete
just as the latter was pulling on his slouch hat.</p>

<p>"I get a shiver every time I see a man do that,"
he said.</p>

<p>"That? That's nothin'," said Pete. "I'd a
heap ruther do that than work down in the street.
Down in the street, why, who knows when a brick's
agoin' to fall on your head!"</p>

<p>"Um!" Mr. Driscoll remembered himself and
his eyes clicked. He turned from Pete, and called
to the young foreman: "I'll look at the riveters now."</p>

<p>"All right. Oh, Barry!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>There came toward Tom a little, stocky man, commonly
known as "Rivet Head." Someone had
noted the likeness of his cranium to a newly-hammered
rivet, and the nickname had stuck.</p>

<p>"Get the other four columns up out of the street
before setting any more," Tom ordered, and then
walked with Mr. Driscoll to where the head of a
ladder stuck up through the flooring.</p>

<p>Pete, with a sour look, watched Mr. Driscoll's
round body awkwardly disappear down the ladder.</p>

<p>"Boys, if I was a preacher, I know how I'd run
my business," he remarked.</p>

<p>"How, Pete?" queried one of the gang.</p>

<p>"I'd stand up Driscoll in the middle o' the road
to hell, then knock off workin' forever. When they
seen him standin' there every blamed sinner'd turn
back with a yell an' stretch their legs for the other
road."</p>

<p>"I wonder if Tom'll speak to him about them
scabs," said another man, with a scowl at a couple
of men working along the building's edge.</p>

<p>"That ain't Tom's business, Bill," answered Pete.
"It's Rivet Head's. Tom don't like Driscoll any
more'n the rest of us do, an' he ain't goin' to say any
more to him'n he has to."</p>

<p>"Tom ought to call him down, anyhow," Bill
declared.</p>

<p>"You let Foley do that," put in Jake Henderson,
a big fellow with a stubbly face and a scar across
his nose.</p>

<p>"An' let him peel off a little graft!" sneered
Bill.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>"Close yer face!" growled Jake.</p>

<p>"Come on there, boys, an' get that crane around!"
shouted Barry.</p>

<p>Pete, Bill, and Jake sprang to the wooden lever
that extended from the base of the ninety-foot mast;
and they threw their weight against the bar, bending
it as a bow. The crane slowly turned on its bearings
to the desired position. Barry, the "pusher"
(under foreman), waved his outstretched hand.
The signalman, whose eyes had been alert for this
movement, pulled a rope; a bell rang in the ears
of an engineer, twenty-one floors below. The big
boom slowly came down to a horizontal position, its
outer end twenty feet clear of the building's edge.
Another signal, and the heavy iron pulley began to
descend to the street.</p>

<p>After the pulley had started to slide down its
rope there was little for the men to do till it had
climbed back up the rope with its burden of steel.
Pete&mdash;who was usually addressed as "Pig Iron,"
perhaps for the reason that he claimed to be from
Pittsburg&mdash;settled back at his ease among the gang,
his back against a pile of columns, his legs stretched
out.</p>

<p>"I've just picked out the apartment where I'm
goin' to keep my celluloid collar when this here
shanty's finished," he remarked. "Over in the
corner there, lookin' down in both streets. I ain't
goin' to do nothin' but wear kid gloves, an' lean out
the windows an' spit on you roughnecks as you go
by. An' my boodwar is goin' to have about seventeen
push-buttons in it. Whenever I want any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>thing
I'll just push a button, an' up'll hot-foot a
nigger with it in a suit o' clothes that's nothin' but
shirt front. Then I'll kick the nigger, an' push
another button. That's life, boys. An' I'll have
plush chairs, carpets a foot thick, an iv'ry bath-tub&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Pete's wandering gaze caught one man watching
him with serious eyes, and he broke off. "Say, Johnson,
wha' d'you suppose I want a bath-tub for?"</p>

<p>Johnson was an anomaly among the iron-workers&mdash;a
man without a sense of humor. He never knew
when his fellows were joking and when serious; he
usually took them literally.</p>

<p>"To wash in," he answered.</p>

<p>Pete whistled. "Wash in it! Ain't you got no
respect for the traditions o' the workin' class?"</p>

<p>"Hey, Pig Iron; talk English!" Bill demanded.
"What's traditions?"</p>

<p>Pete looked puzzled, and a laugh passed about the
men. Then his sang-froid returned. "Your traditions,
Bill, is the things you'd try to forget about
yourself if you had enough coin to move into a place
like this."</p>

<p>He turned his lean face back on Johnson. "Don't
you know what a bath-tub's for, Johnson? Don't
you never read the papers? Well, here's how it is:
The landlords come around wearin' about a sixteen-candle-power
incandescent smile. They puts in marble
bath-tubs all through all the houses. They're goin'
to elevate us. The next day they come around again
to see how we've improved. They throw up their
hands, an' let out a few yells. There's them bath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>-tubs
chuck full o' coal. We didn't know what they
was for,&mdash;an' they was very handy for coal. That's
us. It's down in the papers. An' here you, Johnson,
you'd ruin our repitations by usin' the bath-tubs to
bathe in."</p>

<p>The pulley toiled into view, dragging after it two
columns. Johnson was saved the necessity of response.
The men hurried to their places.</p>

<p>"O' course, Pig Iron, you'll be fixed all right when
you've moved in here," began Bill, after the boom
had reached out and the pulley had started spinning
down for the other two columns. "But how about
the rest of us fixers? Three seventy-five a day, when
we get in only six or seven months a year, ain't makin'
bankers out o' many of us."</p>

<p>"Only a few," admitted Pete; "an' them few ain't
the whole cheese yet. Me, I can live on three seventy-five,
but I don't see how you married men do."</p>

<p>"Especially with scabs stealin' your jobs," growled
Bill, glancing again at the two men working along the
building's edge.</p>

<p>"I told you Foley'd look after them," said Barry,
who had joined the group for a moment. "It hustles
most of us to keep up with the game," he went
on, in answer to Pete's last remark. "Some of us
don't. An' rents an' everything else goin' up. I
don't know what we're goin' to do."</p>

<p>"That's easy," said Pete. "Get more money or
live cheaper."</p>

<p>"How're we goin' to live cheaper?" demanded
Bill.</p>

<p>"Yes, how?" seconded Barry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm for more money," declared Bill.</p>

<p>"Well, I reckon I wear the same size shoe," said
Pete. "More money&mdash;that's me."</p>

<p>"And me," "and me," joined in the other men,
except Johnson.</p>

<p>"It's about time we were gettin' more," Pete
advanced. "The last two years the bosses have
been doin' the genteel thing by their own pockets,
all right."</p>

<p>"We've got to have more if our kids are goin'
to know a couple o' facts more'n we do." Barry went
over to the edge of the building and watched the
tiny figures attaching the columns to the pulley hook.</p>

<p>"That's right," said Pete. "You don't stand no
chance these days to climb up on top of a good job
unless you ripped off a lot o' education when you was
young an' riveted it on to your mem'ry. I heard a
preacher once. He preached about education. He
said if you wanted to get up anywhere you had to be
educated like hell. He was right, too. If you left
school when you was thirteen, why, by the time you're
twenty-seven an' had a few drinks you ain't very
likely to be just what I'd call a college on legs."</p>

<p>"Keating, he thinks we ought to go after more
this spring," said Bill.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Foley thinks?" queried another
of the men.</p>

<p>"If Tom's for a strike, why, Foley'll be again'
it," one of the gang answered. "You can place your
money on that color."</p>

<p>"Tom certainly did pour the hot shot into Foley
at the meetin' last night," said Bill, grinning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
"Grafter! He called Buck about thirteen diff'rent
kind."</p>

<p>"If Keating's all right in his nut he'll not go round
lookin' for a head-on collision with Buck Foley,"
asserted Jake, with a wise leer at Bill.</p>

<p>Bill answered by giving Jake his back. "Foley
don't want no strike," he declared. "What's he
want to strike for? He's gettin' his hand in the
dough bag enough the way things is now."</p>

<p>"See here, the whole bunch o' you roughnecks give
me a pain!" broke out Pete. "You shoot off your
faces a lot when Buck's not around, but the imitation
you give on meetin' nights of a collection o' mummies
can't be beat. I ain't in love with Buck&mdash;not on your
life! You can tell him so, Jake. But he certainly
has done the union a lot o' good. Tom'd say that,
too. An' you know how much Tom likes Foley.
You fixers forget when you was workin' ten hours
for two dollars, an' lickin' the boots o' the bosses to
hold your jobs."</p>

<p>There was a short silence, then Johnson put forward
cautiously: "I don't see the good o' strikin'."</p>

<p>Pete stared at him. "Why?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Well, I've been in the business longer'n most o'
you boys, an' I ain't found the bosses as bad as you
make 'em out. When they're makin' more, they'll
pay us more."</p>

<p>"Oh, you go tell that to a Sunday school!" snorted
Pete. "D'you ever hear of a boss payin' more
wages'n he had to? Not much! Them kind 'o
bosses's all doin' business up in heaven. If we was
actually earnin' twenty a day, d'you suppose we'd get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
a cent more'n three seventy-five till we'd licked the
bosses. You do&mdash;hey? That shows the kind of a
nut you've got. The boss 'ud buy a tutti-frutti yacht,
or a few more automobiles, or mebbe a college or two,
where they learn you how to wear your pants turned
up; but all the extra money you'd get wouldn't pay
for the soap used by a Dago. If ever a boss offers
you an extra dollar before you've licked him, yell
for a cop. He's crazy."</p>

<p>Pete's tirade completely flustered Johnson. "All
the same, what I said's so."</p>

<p>Pete snorted again. "When d'you think you're
livin'? You make me tired, Johnson. Go push
yourself off the roof!"</p>

<p>The two last columns rose swinging above the
chasm's brink, and there was no more talk for that
afternoon. For the next hour the men were busy
setting the last of the columns which were to support
the twenty-second and twenty-third stories. Then
they began setting in the cross beams, walking about
on these five-inch beams (perhaps on one with the
pavement straight beneath it) with the matter-of-fact
steps of a man on the sidewalk&mdash;a circus act, lacking
a safety net below, and lacking flourishes and kisses
blown to a thrilled audience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Chapter_II" id="Chapter_II"></a>Chapter II</h2>

<p class="chap">THE WALKING DELEGATE</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idci.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">It was toward the latter part of the afternoon
that a tall, angular man, in a black
overcoat and a derby hat, stepped from
the ladder on to the loose planking,
glanced about and walked over to the gang of men
about the south crane.</p></div>

<p>"Hello, Buck," they called out on sight of him.</p>

<p>"Hello, boys," he answered carelessly.</p>

<p>He stood, with hands in the pockets of his overcoat,
smoking his cigar, watching the crane accurately
swing a beam to its place, and a couple of men run
along it and bolt it at each end to the columns. He
had a face to hold one's look&mdash;lean and long: gray,
quick eyes, set close together; high cheek bones, with
the dull polish of bronze; a thin nose, with a vulturous
droop; a wide tight mouth; a great bone of a
chin;&mdash;a daring, incisive, masterful face.</p>

<p>When the beam had been bolted to its place,
Barry, with a reluctance he tried to conceal, walked
over to Foley.</p>

<p>"How's things?" asked the new-comer, rolling his
cigar into the corner of his mouth and slipping his
words out between barely parted lips.</p>

<p>Barry was the steward on the job,&mdash;the union's
representative. "Two snakes come on the job this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
mornin'," he reported. "Them two over there,&mdash;that
Squarehead an' that Guinea. I was goin' to
write you a postal card about 'em to-night."</p>

<p>"Who put 'em to work?"</p>

<p>"They said Duffy, Driscoll's superintendent."</p>

<p>Foley grunted, and his eyes fastened thoughtfully
on the two non-union men.</p>

<p>"When the boys seen they had no cards, o' course
they said they wouldn't work with the scabs. But I
said we'd stand 'em to-day, an' let you straighten it
out to-morrow."</p>

<p>"We'll fix it now." The walking delegate, with
deliberate steps, moved toward the two men, who
were sitting astride an outside beam fitting in bolts.</p>

<p>He paused beside the Italian. "Clear out!" he
ordered quietly. He did not take his hands from his
pockets.</p>

<p>The Italian looked up, and without answer doggedly
resumed twisting a nut.</p>

<p>Foley's eyes narrowed. His lips tightened upon
his cigar. Suddenly his left hand gripped the head
of a column and his right seized the shirt and coat
collar of the Italian. He jerked the man outward,
unseating him, though his legs clung about the beam,
and held him over the street. The Italian let out a
frightful yell, that the wind swept along under the
clouds; and his wrench went flying from his hand.
It struck close beside a mason on a scaffold seventeen
stories below. The mason gave a jump, looked up
and shook his fist.</p>

<p>"D'youse see the asphalt?" Foley demanded.</p>

<p>The man, whose down-hanging face was forced to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
see the pavement far below, with the little hats moving
about over it, shrilled out his fear again.</p>

<p>"In about a minute youse'll be layin' there, as flat
as a picture, if youse don't clear out!"</p>

<p>The man answered with a mixture of Italian, English,
and yells; from which Foley gathered that he
was willing to go, but preferred to gain the street by
way of the ladders rather than by the direct route.</p>

<p>Foley jerked him back to his seat, and a pair of
frantic arms gripped his legs. "Now chase yourself,
youse scab! Or&mdash;&mdash;" Foley knew how to
swear.</p>

<p>The Italian rose tremblingly and stepped across to
the flooring. He dropped limply to a seat on a
prostrate column, and moaned into his hands.</p>

<p>Without glancing at him or at the workmen who
had eyed this measure doubtfully, Foley moved over
to the Swede and gripped him as he had the Italian.
"Now youse, youse sneakin' Squarehead! Get out
o' here, too!"</p>

<p>The Swede's right hand came up and laid hold of
Foley's wrist with a grip that made the walking delegate
start. The scab rose to his feet and stepped
across to the planking. Foley was tall, but the Swede
out-topped him by an inch.</p>

<p>"I hold ma yob, yes," growled the Swede, a sudden
flame coming into his heavy eyes.</p>

<p>Foley had seen that look in a thousand scabs' eyes
before. He knew its meaning. He drew back a
pace, pulled his derby hat tightly down on his head
and bit into his cigar, every lean muscle alert.</p>

<p>"Get off the job! Or I'll kick youse off!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>The Swede stepped forward, his shoulders hunched
up. Foley crouched back; his narrowed gray eyes
gleamed. The men in both gangs looked on from
their places about the cranes and up on the beams
in statued expectation. Barry and Pig Iron hurried
up to Foley's support.</p>

<p>"Keep back!" he ordered sharply. They fell
away from him.</p>

<p>A minute passed&mdash;the two men standing on the
loosely-planked edge of a sheer precipice, watching
each other with tense eyes. Suddenly a change began
in the Swede; the spirit went out of him as the glow
from a cooling rivet. His arms sank to his side, and
he turned and fairly slunk over to where lay an old
brown overcoat.</p>

<p>The men started with relief, then burst into a jeering
laugh. Foley moved toward Barry, then paused
and, with hands back in his pockets, watched the two
scabs make their preparation to leave, trundling his
cigar about with his thin prehensile lips. As they
started down the ladder, the Swede sullen, the Italian
still trembling, he walked over to them with sudden
decision.</p>

<p>"Go on back to work," he ordered.</p>

<p>The two looked at him in surprised doubt.</p>

<p>"Go on!" He jerked his head toward the places
they had left.</p>

<p>They hesitated; then the Swede lay off his old coat
and started back to his place, and the Italian followed,
his fearful eyes on the walking delegate.</p>

<p>Foley rejoined Barry. "I'm goin' to settle this
thing with Driscoll," he said to the pusher, loudly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
answering the amazed questioning he saw in the eyes
of all the men. "I'm goin' to settle the scab question
for good with him. Let them two snakes work
till youse hear from me."</p>

<p>He paused, then asked abruptly: "Where's Keating?"</p>

<p>"Down with the riveters."</p>

<p>"So-long, boys," he called to Barry's gang; and at
the head of the ladder he gestured a farewell to the
gang about the other crane. Then his long body
sank through the flooring.</p>

<p>At the bottom of the thirty-foot ladder he paused
and looked around through the maze of beams and
columns. This floor was not boarded, as was the
one he had just left. Here and there were little
platforms on which stood small portable forges, a
man at each turning the fan and stirring the rivets
among the red coals; and here and there were groups
of three men, driving home the rivets. At regular
intervals each heater would take a white rivet from
his forge, toss it from his tongs sizzling through the
air to a man twenty feet away, who would deftly
catch it in a tin can. This man would seize the
glowing bit of steel with a pair of pincers, strike
it smartly against a beam, at which off would go a
spray of sparks like an exploding rocket, and then
thrust it through its hole. Immediately the terrific
throbbing of a pneumatic hammer, held hard against
the rivet by another man, would clinch it to its
destiny of clinging with all its might. And then,
flashing through the gray air like a meteor at twilight,
would come another sparkling rivet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>And on all sides, beyond the workmen calmly playing
at catch with white-hot steel, and beyond the
black crosswork of beams and columns, Foley could
see great stretches of housetops that in sullen rivalry
strove to overmatch the dinginess of the sky.</p>

<p>Foley caught sight of Tom with a riveting gang at
the southeast corner of the building, and he started
toward him, walking over the five-inch beams with a
practiced step, and now and then throwing a word at
some of the men he passed, and glancing casually
down at the workmen putting in the concrete flooring
three stories below. Tom had seen him coming, and
had turned his back upon his approach.</p>

<p>"H'are you, Buck!" shouted one of the gang.</p>

<p>Though Foley was but ten feet away, it was the
man's lips alone that gave greeting to him; the
ravenous din of the pneumatic hammer devoured
every other sound. He shouted a reply; his lip movements
signaled to the man: "Hello, fellows."</p>

<p>Tom still kept his ignoring back upon Foley.
The walking delegate touched him on the shoulder.
"I'd like to trade some words with youse," he remarked.</p>

<p>Tom's set face regarded him steadily an instant;
then he said: "All right."</p>

<p>"Come on." Foley led the way across beams to
the opposite corner of the building where there was a
platform now deserted by its forge, and where the
noise was slightly less dense. For a space the two
men looked squarely into each other's face&mdash;Tom's
set, Foley's expressionless&mdash;as if taking the measure
of the other;&mdash;and meanwhile the great framework<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
shivered, and the air rattled, under the impact of the
throbbing hammers. They were strikingly similar,
and strikingly dissimilar. Aggressiveness, fearlessness,
self-confidence, a sense of leadership, showed
themselves in the faces and bearing of the two, though
all three qualities were more pronounced in the older
man. Their dissimilarity was summed up in their
eyes: there was something to take and hold your confidence
in Tom's; Foley's were full of deep, resourceful
cunning.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Tom, at length.</p>

<p>"What's your game?" asked Foley in a tone
that was neither friendly nor unfriendly. "Wha'
d'youse want?"</p>

<p>"Nothing,&mdash;from you."</p>

<p>Foley went on in the same colorless tone. "I don't
know. Youse've been doin' a lot o' growlin' lately.
I've had a lot o' men fightin' me. Most of 'em
wanted to be bought off."</p>

<p>Tom recognized in these words a distant overture
of peace,&mdash;a peace that if accepted would be profitable
to him. He went straight to Foley's insinuated
meaning.</p>

<p>"You ought to know that's not my size," he
returned quietly. "You've tried to buy me off
more than once."</p>

<p>The mask went from Foley's face and his mouth
and forehead creased into harsh lines. His words
came out like whetted steel. "See here. I would
pass over the kind o' talkin' youse've been doin'.
Somebody's always growlin'. Somebody's got to
growl. But what youse said at the meetin' last night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
I ain't goin' to stand for that kind o' talk. Youse
understand?"</p>

<p>Tom's legs had spread themselves apart, his black-gloved
hands had placed themselves upon his hips,
and his brown eyes were looking hard defiance from
beneath his cap's peak. "I don't suppose you did
like it," he said calmly. "If I remember rightly I
didn't say it for the purpose of pleasing you."</p>

<p>"Youse're goin' to keep your mouth goin' then?"</p>

<p>"My mouth's my own."</p>

<p>"Mebbe youse knows what happened to a few
other gents that started on the road youse're travelin'?"
the steely voice went on insinuatingly. "Duncan&mdash;Smith&mdash;O'Malley?"</p>

<p>"Threats, huh?" Tom's anger began to pass his
control. He sneered. "Save 'em for somebody
that's afraid of you!"</p>

<p>The cigar that had so far kept its place in Foley's
mouth now fell out, and a few lurid words followed
it. "D'youse know I can drive youse clean out o'
New York? Yes, an' fix youse so youse can't get a
job in the iron trade in the country? Except as a
scab. Which's just about what you are!"</p>

<p>The defiant glow in Tom's eyes flared into a blaze
of anger. He stepped up to Foley, his fists still on
his hips, and fairly thrust his square face into the
lean one of the walking delegate.</p>

<p>"If you think I'm afraid of you, Buck Foley, or
your bunch of toughs, you're almighty mistaken!
I'm going to say what I think about you, and say it
whenever and wherever I please!"</p>

<p>Foley's face tightened. His hands clenched in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
pockets. But he controlled himself. He had the
wisdom of a thousand fights,&mdash;which is, never to fight
unless you have to, or unless there is something to
gain. "I've got just one thing to say to youse, an'
that's all," he said, and his low, steely voice cut distinctly
through the hammer's uproar. "If I hear
any more about your talk,&mdash;well, Duncan an' O'Malley'll
have some new company."</p>

<p>He turned about shortly, and stepped along beams
to a ladder, and down that; leaving Tom struggling
with a furious desire to follow and close with him.
Out of the building, he made for the office of Mr.
Driscoll as rapidly as street car could take him. On
leaving the elevator in the Broadway building he
strode to a door marked "Driscoll &amp; Co.&mdash;Private&mdash;Enter
Next Door," and without hesitation turned the
knob. He found himself in a small room, very neat,
whose principal furniture was a letter file and a desk
bearing a typewriter. Over the desk was a brown
print of William Morris. The room had two inner
doors, one, as Foley knew, opening into the general
offices, and the other into Mr. Driscoll's private
room.</p>

<p>A young woman rose from the desk. "What is
it?" she asked, with a coldness drawn forth by his
disregard of the sign on the door.</p>

<p>"I want to see Mr. Driscoll. Tell him Foley
wants to speak to him."</p>

<p>She went through Mr. Driscoll's door, and Foley
heard his name announced. There was a hesitant
silence, then he heard the words, "Well, let him
come in, Miss Arnold."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Arnold immediately reappeared. "Will
you step in, please."</p>

<p>As he entered the door Foley put on his hat, which
he had removed in the presence of the secretary, pulling
it aggressively down over one eye.</p>

<p>"Hello, Driscoll," he greeted the contractor, who
had swung about from a belittered desk; and he
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll pointed to a chair, but his face deepened
a shade. Foley seated himself, and leaned forward
with his elbows on his knees, his bony hands
clasped.</p>

<p>"Well, what can I do for you?" queried Mr.
Driscoll shortly.</p>

<p>Foley knew his man. He had met Mr. Driscoll
many times at conferences with the Executive Committee
of the Iron Employers' Association, and
had read him as though he were large print. He
noted with satisfaction the color in the contractor's
face.</p>

<p>The walking delegate spoke with extreme deliberation.
"I come around, <i>Mister</i> Driscoll, to find out
what the hell youse mean by workin' scabs on that
St. Etienne job. Youse signed an agreement to work
only union men, but if I didn't watch youse, youse'd
have your work alive with scabs. Now, damn youse,
unless youse get them scabs off that job an' do it
quicker'n youse ever done anything before, youse'll
wish youse had!"</p>

<p>Foley made no mistake in his pre-calculation of the
effect of this speech. Mr. Driscoll sprang to his feet,
with a trembling that his reddish-gray whiskers exag<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>gerated.
His glasses tumbled from his nose, and his
feet scrunched them unnoted into the rug. "If
there's a scab on the job, I didn't know it. If those
men're scabs Duffy must have made a mistake.
If&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"If one o' youse bosses ever breaks a contract, oh,
it's always a mistake!"</p>

<p>"If you'd come around here and talked like a
gentleman, I'd had 'em off inside of an hour," Mr.
Driscoll roared. "But, by thunder, I don't let any
walking delegate insult me and tell me what I've <i>got</i>
to do!"</p>

<p>"Then youse ain't goin' to fire the scabs?"</p>

<p>"Not till hell freezes over!"</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll's eyes clicked, and he banged his
pudgy fist upon his desk.</p>

<p>"Then the men'll go back to work on the day hell
freezes over," returned Foley, rising to go. "But I
have an idea youse'll want to see me a day or two
before then. I've come to youse this time. The
next time we talk, youse'll come to me. There's
my card." And he went out with the triumphant
feeling of the man who can guide events.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock the next morning he clambered again
to the top of the St. Etienne Hotel. The Italian and
Swede were still at work.</p>

<p>"Lay down your tools, boys!" he called out to
the two gangs. "The job's struck!"</p>

<p>The men crowded around him, demanding information.</p>

<p>"Driscoll won't fire the scabs," he explained.</p>

<p>"Kick 'em off,&mdash;settle it that-a-way!" growled one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
of the men. "We can't afford to lose wages on
account o' two scabs."</p>

<p>"That'd only settle this one case. We've got to
settle the scab question with Driscoll for good an'
all. It's hard luck, boys, I know," he said sympathetically,
"but we can't do nothin' but strike.
We've got to lick Driscoll into shape."</p>

<p>Leaving the men talking hotly as they changed
their clothes for the street, Foley went down the
ladder to bear the same message and the same comfort
to the riveters.</p>

<p>The next morning the general contractor for the
building got Mr. Driscoll on the telephone. "Why
aren't you getting that ironwork up?" he demanded.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll started into an explanation of his
trouble with Foley, but the general contractor cut
him short. "I don't care what the trouble is. What
I care about is that you're not getting that ironwork
up. Get your men right back to work."</p>

<p>"How?" queried Mr. Driscoll sarcastically.</p>

<p>"That's your business!" answered the general contractor,
and rang off.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll talked it over with the "Co.," a
young fellow of thirty or thereabouts, of polished
manner and irreproachable tailoring. "See Foley,"
Mr. Berman advised.</p>

<p>"It's simply a game for graft!"</p>

<p>"That may be," said the junior partner. "But
what can you do?"</p>

<p>"I won't pay graft!"</p>

<p>Mr. Berman shrugged his shapely shoulders and
withdrew. Mr. Driscoll paced his office floor, tugged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
at his whiskers, and used some language that at
least had the virtue of being terse. With the consequence,
that he saw there was nothing for him but
to settle as best as he could. In furious mortification
he wrote to Foley asking him to call. The answer
was a single scrawled sentence: "If you want to see
me, I live at&mdash;West One Hundred and Fifteenth
Street."</p>

<p>The instant after this note was read its fragments
were in Mr. Driscoll's waste basket. He'd suffer a
sulphurous fate before he'd do it! But the general
contractor descended upon him in person, and there
was a bitter half hour. The result was that late Saturday
afternoon Mr. Driscoll locked his pride in his
desk, put his checkbook in his pocket, and set forth
for the number on West One Hundred and Fifteenth
Street.</p>

<p>A large woman, of dark voluptuous beauty, with a
left hand like a jeweller's tray, answered his knock
and led him into the parlor, on whose furnishings
more money than taste had been spent. The room
was a war of colors, in which the gilt of the picture
frames, enclosing oblongs of high-hued sentiment,
had the best of the conflict, and in which baby blue,
showing in pictures, upholstery and a fancy lamp
shade, was an easy second, despite its infantility.</p>

<p>Foley sat in a swinging rocker, reading an evening
paper, his coat off, his feet in slippers. He did not
rise. "Hello! Are they havin' zero weather in
hell?"</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll passed the remark. "I guess you
know what I'm here for."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p>"If youse give me three guesses, I might be able
to hit it. But chair bottom's as cheap as carpet. Set
down."</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll sank into an upholstered chair, and a
skirmish began between his purple face and the baby
blue of the chair's back. "Let's get to business,"
he said.</p>

<p>"Won't youse have a drink first?" queried Foley,
with baiting hospitality.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll's hands clenched the arms of the
chair. "Let's get to business."</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;fire away."</p>

<p>"You know what it is."</p>

<p>"I can't say's I do," Foley returned urbanely.</p>

<p>The contractor's hands dug again into the upholstery.
"About the strike you called on the St.
Etienne."</p>

<p>"Oh, that!&mdash;Well?"</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll gulped down pride and anger and
went desperately to the point. "What'll I have to
do to settle it?"</p>

<p>"Um! Le's see. First of all, youse'll fire the
scabs?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Seems to me I give youse the chance to do that
before, an' end it right there. But it can't end there
now. There's the wages the men's lost. Youse'll
have to pay waitin' time."</p>

<p>"Extortion, you mean," Mr. Driscoll could not
refrain from saying.</p>

<p>"Waitin' time," Foley corrected blandly.</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;how much?" Mr. Driscoll remarked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
to himself that he knew what part of the "waiting
time" the men would get.</p>

<p>Foley looked at the ceiling and appeared to calculate.
"The waitin' time'll cost youse an even thousand."</p>

<p>"What!"</p>

<p>"If youse ain't learnt your lesson yet, youse might
as well go back." He made as if to resume his paper.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll swallowed hard. "Oh, I'll pay.
What else can I do? You've got me in a corner with
a gun to my head."</p>

<p>Foley did not deny the similitude. "youse're gettin'
off dirt cheap."</p>

<p>"When'll the men go back to work?"</p>

<p>"The minute youse pay, the strike's off."</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll drew out his check-book, and started
to fill in a check with a fountain pen.</p>

<p>"Hold on there!" Foley cried. "No checks for
me."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with a check?"</p>

<p>"Youse don't catch me scatterin' my name round
on the back o' checks. D'youse think I was born
yesterday?"</p>

<p>"Where's the danger, since the money's to go to
the men for waiting time?" Mr. Driscoll asked
sarcastically.</p>

<p>"It's cash or nothin'," Foley said shortly.</p>

<p>"I've no money with me. I'll bring it some time
next week."</p>

<p>"Just as youse like. Only every day raises the
price."</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll made haste to promise to deliver the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
money Monday morning as soon as he could get it
from his bank. And Foley thereupon promised to
have the men ready to go back to work Monday
afternoon. So much settled, Mr. Driscoll started to
leave. He was suffocating.</p>

<p>"Won't youse have a drink?" Foley asked again,
at the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll wanted only to get out of Foley's
company, where he could explode without having it
put in the bill. "No," he said curtly.</p>

<p>"Well!&mdash;now me, when I got to swallow a pill I
like somethin' to wash it down."</p>

<p>The door slammed, and Mr. Driscoll puffed down
the stairs leaving behind him a trail of language like
a locomotive's plume.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE RISE OF BUCK FOLEY</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idct.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">Tom glared at Foley till the walking delegate
had covered half the distance to the
ladder, then he turned back to his supervision,
trying to hide the fires of his wrath.
But his soul flamed within him. All that Foley had
just threatened, openly and by insinuation, was within
his power of accomplishment. Tom knew that.
And every other man in the union was as much at his
mercy,&mdash;and every man's family. And many had
suffered greatly, and all, except Foley's friends, had
suffered some. Tom's mind ran over the injustice
Foley had wrought, and over Foley's history and the
union's history during the last few years ... and
there was no sinking of the inward fire.</p></div>

<p>And yet there was a long period in the walking delegate's
history on which Tom would not have passed
harsh judgment. Very early in his career, in conformity
with prevailing custom, Buck Foley had had
a father and a mother. His mother he did not
remember at all. After she had intimated a preference
for another man by eloping with him, Buck's
father had become afflicted with almost constant unsteadiness
in his legs, an affliction that had before
victimized him only at intervals. His father he
remembered chiefly from having carried a tin pail to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
a store around the corner where a red-faced man filled
it and handed it back to him over a high counter; and
also from a white scar which even now his hair did
not altogether conceal. One day his father disappeared.
Not long after that Buck went to live in a
big house with a great lot of boys, the little ones in
checked pinafores, the big ones in gray suits. After
six years of life here, at the age of twelve, he considered
that he was fit for graduation, and so he went
out into the world,&mdash;this on a very dark night when
all in the big house were fast asleep.</p>

<p>For three years Buck was a newsboy; sleeping in a
bed when he could afford one, sleeping in hallways,
over warm gratings, along the docks, when he could
not; winning all the newsboy's keen knowledge of
human nature. At fifteen the sea fascinated him, and
he lived in ships till he was twenty. Then a sailor's
duties began to irk him. He came back to New
York, took the first job that offered, driving a truck,
and joined a political club of young men in a west side
ward. Here he found himself. He rose rapidly to
power in the club. Dan McGuire, the boss of the
ward, had to take notice of him. He left his truck
for a city job with a comfortable salary and nothing
to do. At twenty-five he was one of McGuire's
closest aids. Then his impatient ambition escaped
his control. He plotted a revolution, which should
overthrow McGuire and enthrone himself. But the
Boss had thirty years of political cunning, and behind
him a strong machine. For these Buck was no match.
He took again to the sea.</p>

<p>Buck shipped as second mate on a steamer carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>ing
steel for a great bridge in South Africa. Five
years of authority had unfitted him for the subordinate
position of second mate, and there were many
tilts with the thick-headed captain. The result was
that after the steamer had discharged her cargo
Foley quitted his berth and followed the steel into the
interior. The contractors were in sore need of men,
and, even though Foley was not a bridgeman, they
gladly gave him a job. His service as a sailor had
fitted him to follow, without a twinge of fear, the
most expert of the bridgemen in their daring clambering
about cables and over narrow steel beams; and
being naturally skillful he rapidly became an efficient
workman.</p>

<p>Of the men sent out to this distant job perhaps one-half
were union members. These formed a local
branch of their society, and this Foley was induced
to join. He rapidly won to influence and power in the
affairs of the union, finding here the same keen enjoyment
in managing men that he had first tasted in Dan
McGuire's ward. After the completion of this job
he worked in Scotland and Brazil, always active in
the affairs of his union. At thirty-two he found himself
back in New York,&mdash;a forceful leader ripe for an
opportunity.</p>

<p>He had not been in New York a week when he discovered
his chance. The union there was wofully
weak&mdash;an organization only in name. The employers
hardly gave it a consideration; the members themselves
hardly held it in higher esteem. The men
were working ten hours a day for two dollars; lacking
the support of a strong union they were afraid to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
seek better terms. As Foley grimly expressed it,
"The bosses have got youse down an' are settin' on
your heads." Here in this utter disorganization
Foley perceived his opportunity. He foresaw the
extent to which the erection of steel-frame buildings,
then in its beginning, was certain to develop. His
trade was bound to become the "fundamental trade";
until his union had put up the steel frames the contractors
could do nothing&mdash;the other workmen could
do nothing. A strongly organized union holding this
power&mdash;there was no limit to the concessions it might
demand and secure.</p>

<p>It was a great opportunity. Foley went quietly to
work on a job at twelve dollars a week, and bided his
time. At the end of six months he was elected president
and walking delegate of the union. He had no
trouble in securing the offices. No one else wanted
them. This was early in the spring. The first labor
he set himself was the thorough organization of the
union and the taking into its ranks of every ironworker
in the city.</p>

<p>The following spring there was a strike. Foley
now came for the first time before the contractors'
attention. They regarded him lightly, having remembrance
of his predecessors. But they soon found
they were facing a man who, though uneducated and
of ungrammatical speech, was as keen and powerful
as the best of them. The strike was won, and great
was the name of Foley. In the next three years there
were two more strikes for increases in wages, which
were won. And the name of Foley waxed greater.</p>

<p>During these first four years no man could have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
served the union better. But here ended the stretch
of Foley's history on which Tom would not have
passed harsh judgment; and here began the period
whose acts of corruption and oppression were now
moving in burning procession through Tom's mind.
It is a matter of no moment whether Foley or the
employers took the initiative in starting him on the
new phase of his career as a labor leader. It is
axiomatic that money is the ammunition of war;
among the employers there were many who were
indifferent whether this ammunition was spent in fighting
or in buying. On the other hand, Foley's training
on the street and in Dan McGuire's ward was not
such as to produce an incorruptible integrity. It is
only fair to Foley to say that the first sums he received
were in return for services which did not work any
injury or loss to the union. It was easy to excuse to
himself these first lapses. He knew his own worth;
he saw that men of much less capacity in the employ
of the bosses were paid big salaries. The union paid
him thirty dollars a week. "Who's hurt if I increase
my salary to something like it ought to be at the
expense of the bosses?" he reasoned; and took the
money with an easy conscience.</p>

<p>This first "easy money" made Foley hungry for
more. He saw the many opportunities that existed
for acquiring it; he saw where he could readily create
other opportunities. In earlier days he had envied
McGuire the chances that were his. He had no reason
to envy McGuire now.</p>

<p>During the first three or four years of his administration
there was no opposition to him within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
union. His work was too strenuous to be envied him
by any man. But after the union had become an
established power, and the position of walking delegate
one of prominence, a few ambitious spirits began
to aspire to his job. Also there began to be mutterings
about his grafting. A party was formed which
secretly busied itself with a plan to do to him what he
had tried to do to Dan McGuire. He triumphed, as
McGuire had triumphed. But the revolution, though
unsuccessful, had a deep lesson for him. It taught
him that, unless he fortified it, his position was insecure.
At present he was dependent for its retention
upon the favor of the members; and favor, as he
knew, was not a dependable quantity.</p>

<p>He was determined to remain the walking delegate
of the union. He had made the union, and the
position. They were both his by right. He rapidly
took measures to insure himself against the possibility
of overthrow. He became relentless to all opposition.
Those who dared talk were quick to hear from
him. Some fared easily&mdash;the clever ones who were
not bribe-proof. After being given jobs as foremen,
and presented with neat little sums, they readily saw
the justice of Foley's cause. Some, who were not
worth bribing, he intimidated into silence. Those
whom he had threatened and who still talked found
themselves out of work and unable to get new jobs;
they were forced into other trades or out of the city.
A few such examples lessened the necessity for such
severe action. Men with families to support perceived
the value of a discreet tongue.</p>

<p>These methods were successful in quelling open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
opposition; but they, together with the knowledge
that Foley was taking money wherever it was offered,
had the effect of rapidly alienating the better element
in the union. This forced him into a close alliance
with the rougher members, who were greatly in the
minority. But this minority, never more than five
hundred out of three thousand men, Foley made
immensely effective. He instructed them to make the
meetings as disorderly as possible. His scheme
worked to perfection. The better members came less
and less frequently, and soon the meetings were entirely
in the hands of the roughs. As time passed
Foley grew more and more jealous of his power, and
more and more harsh in the methods used to guard it.
He attached to himself intimately several of the worst
of his followers whom grim facetiousness soon nominated
"The Entertainment Committee." If any one
attacked him now, the bold one did so knowing that
he would probably experience the hospitality of these
gentlemen the first dark night he ventured forth alone.</p>

<p>Such were the conditions behind the acts of tyranny
that Tom furiously overhauled, as he mechanically
directed the work. He had considered these conditions
and acts before, but never with such fierceness
as now. Hitherto he had been, as it were, merely
one citizen, though a more or less prominent one, of
an oppressed nation; now he, as an individual, had
felt the tyrant's malevolence. He had before talked
of the union's getting rid of Foley as a necessary
action, and only the previous night he had gone to
the length of denouncing Foley in open meeting, an
adventurous act that had not been matched in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
union for two years. Perhaps, in the course of time,
his patriotism alone would have pushed him to take
up arms against Foley. But now to his patriotic
indignation there was added the selfish wrath of the
outraged individual,&mdash;and the sum was an impulse
there was no restraining.</p>

<p>Tom was not one who, in a hot moment, for the
assuagement of his wrath, would bang down his fist
and consign himself to a purpose. Here, however,
was a case where wrath made the same demand that
already had been made by cool, moral judgment&mdash;the
dethronement of Foley. And Tom felt in himself
the power for its accomplishment. He was well
furnished with self-confidence,&mdash;lacking which any
man is an engine without fire. During the last five
years&mdash;that is, since he was twenty-five, when he
began to look upon life seriously&mdash;the knowledge had
grown upon him that he was abler, and of stronger
purpose, than his fellows. He had accepted this
knowledge quietly, as a fact. It had not made him
presumptuous; rather it had imposed upon him a
serious sense of duty.</p>

<p>He considered the risks of a fight against Foley.
Personal danger,&mdash;plenty of that, yes,&mdash;but his hot
mind did not care for that. Financial loss,&mdash;he drew
back from thinking what his wife would say; anyhow,
there were his savings, which would keep them for
awhile, if worst came to worst.</p>

<p>As the men were leaving the building at the end of
the day's work, Tom drew Barry and Pete to one
side. "I know you fellows don't like Foley a lot,"
he began abruptly, "but I don't know how far you're<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
willing to go. For my part, I can't stand for him
any longer. Can't we get together to-night and
have a talk?"</p>

<p>To this Barry and Pete agreed.</p>

<p>"Where'bouts?" asked Barry.</p>

<p>Tom hesitated; and he was thinking of his wife
when he said, "How about your house?"</p>

<p>"Glad to have you," was Barry's answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap_1">Tom lived in the district below West
Fourteenth Street, where, to the bewildered
explorer venturing for the first
time into that region, the jumbled streets
seem to have been laid out by an egg-beater.</p></div>

<p>It was almost six o'clock when, hungry and
wrathful, he thrust his latch-key into the door
of his four-room flat. The door opened into blackness.
He gave an irritated groan and groped about
for matches, in the search striking his hip sharply
against the corner of the dining table. A match
found and the gas lit, he sat down in the sitting-room
to await his wife's coming. From the mantel
a square, gilded clock, on which stood a knight in
full armor, counted off the minutes with irritating
deliberation. It struck six; no Maggie. Tom's
impatience rapidly mounted, for he had promised
to be at Barry's at quarter to eight. He was on the
point of going to a restaurant for his dinner, when,
at half-past six, he heard the fumble of a latch-key
in the lock, and in came his wife, followed by their
son, a boy of four, crying from weariness.</p>

<p>She was a rather large, well-formed, and well-featured
young woman, and was showily dressed in
the extreme styles of the cheap department stores.
She was pretty, with the prettiness of cheap jewelry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom rose as she carefully placed her packages on
the table. "You really decided to come home, did
you?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I know I'm late," she said crossly, breathing
heavily. "But it wasn't my fault. I started
early enough. But there was such a mob in the
store you couldn't get anywhere. If you'd been
squeezed and pushed and punched like I was in the
stores and in the street cars, well, you wouldn't say
a word."</p>

<p>"Of course you had to go!"</p>

<p>"I wasn't going to miss a bargain of that kind.
You don't get 'em often."</p>

<p>Tom gazed darkly at the two bulky packages,
the cause of his delayed dinner. "Can I have
something to eat,&mdash;and quick?"</p>

<p>By this time her hat and jacket were off. "Just
as soon as I get back my breath," she said, and began
to undo the packages.</p>

<p>The little boy came to her side.</p>

<p>"I'm so hungry, ma," he whined. "Gimme a
piece."</p>

<p>"Dinner'll be ready in a little while," she answered
carelessly.</p>

<p>"But I can't wait!"&mdash;and he began to cry.</p>

<p>Maggie turned upon him sharply. "If you don't
stop that bawling, Ferdie, you shan't have a bite of
dinner."</p>

<p>The boy cried all the louder.</p>

<p>"Oh, you!" she ejaculated; and took a piece of
coarse cake from the cupboard and handed it to him.
"Now do be still!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span></p>

<p>Ferdinand filled his mouth with the cake, and
she returned to the packages. "I been wanting
something to fill them empty places at the ends of
the mantel this long time, and when I saw the
advertisement in the papers this morning, I said it
was just the thing.... Now there!"</p>

<p>Out of one pasteboard box she had taken a dancing
Swiss shepherdess, of plaster, pink and green and blue,
and out of the other box a dancing Swiss shepherd.
One of these peasants she had put on either side of
the knight, at the ends of the mantel.</p>

<p>"Now, don't you like that?"</p>

<p>Tom looked doubtfully at the latest adornment
of his home. Somehow, he didn't just like it,
though he didn't know why. "I guess it'll do,"
he said at length.</p>

<p>"And they were only thirty-nine cents apiece!
Now when I get a new tidy for the mantel,&mdash;a nice
pink one with flowers. Just you wait!"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;but let's have dinner first."</p>

<p>"In just a minute." With temper restored by
sight of her art treasures, Maggie went into the bedroom
and quickly returned in an old dress. The
dinner of round steak, fried potatoes and coffee was
ready in a very short time. The steak avenged its
hasty preparation by presenting one badly burnt side.
But Tom ate the poor dinner without complaint.
He was used to poor dinners; and his only desire was
to get away and to Barry's.</p>

<p>Once during the meal he looked at his wife, a
question in his mind. Should he tell her? But
his eyes fell back to his plate and he said nothing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
She must know some time, of course&mdash;but he didn't
want the scene now.</p>

<p>But she herself approached uncomfortably near
the subject. She had glanced at him hesitatingly
several times while they were eating; as he was rising
from the table she began resolutely: "I met Mrs.
Jones this afternoon. She told me what you said
about Foley last night at the meeting. Her husband
told her."</p>

<p>Tom paused.</p>

<p>"There's no sense doing a thing of that kind,"
she went on. "Here we are just beginning to have
things a little comfortable. You know well enough
what Foley can do to you if you get him down on
you."</p>

<p>"Well?" Tom said guardedly.</p>

<p>"Well, don't you be that foolish again. We can't
afford it."</p>

<p>"I'll see about it." He went into the sitting-room
and returned with hat and overcoat on. "I'm
going over to Barry's for awhile&mdash;on some business,"
he said, and went out.</p>

<p>Barry and Pete, who boarded with the Barrys,
were waiting in the sitting-room when Tom arrived,&mdash;and
with them sat Mrs. Barry and a boy of about
thirteen and a girl apparently a couple of years
younger, the two children with idle school books in
their laps. Mrs. Barry's sitting-room, also her parlor,
would not have satisfied that amiable lady, the
president of the Society for Instructing Wage-Earners
in House Furnishing. There was a coarse red
Smyrna rug in the middle of the floor; a dingy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
blue-flowered sofa, with three chairs to match (the
sort seen in the windows of cheap furniture stores
on bargain days, marked "Nineteen dollars for
Set"); a table in one corner, bearing a stack of photographs
and a glass vase holding up a bunch of
pink paper roses; a half dozen colored prints in
gilt-and-white plaster frames. The room, however,
quite satisfied Mrs. Barry, and the amiable president
of the S. I. W. E. H. F. would needs have given
benign approval to the room's utter cleanliness.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry, a big, red-faced woman, greeted Tom
heartily. Then she turned to the boy and girl.
"Come on, children. We've got to chase ourselves.
The men folks want to talk." She drove the two
before her wide body into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Tom plunged into the middle of what he had to
say. "We've talked about Foley a lot&mdash;all of us.
We've said other unions are managed decently, honestly&mdash;why
shouldn't ours be? We've said we didn't
like Foley's bulldozing ways. We didn't like the
tough gang he's got into the union. We didn't like
the rough-house meetings. We didn't like his grafting.
We've said we ought to raise up and kick him
out. And then, having said that much, we've gone
back to work&mdash;me, you and all the rest of us&mdash;and
he's kept on bullying us, and using the union as a
lever to pry off graft. I'm dead sick of this sort
of business. For one, I'm tired talking. I'm ready
for doing."</p>

<p>"Sure, we're all sick o' Foley. But what d'you
think we ought to do?" queried Barry.</p>

<p>"Fire him out," Tom answered shortly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"It only takes three words to say that," said
Pig Iron. "But how?"</p>

<p>"Fire him out!" Tom was leaning forward in
his chair, his elbows on his knees, his big, red hands
interlocked. There was determination in his square
face, in the set of his powerful red neck, in the hunch
of his big shoulders. He gazed steadily at the two
men for a brief space. "Boys, my mind's made
up. I'm going to fight him."</p>

<p>Pete and Barry looked at him in amazement.</p>

<p>"You're goin' to fight Buck Foley!" cried Barry.</p>

<p>"You're jokin'!" said Pig Iron.</p>

<p>"I'm in dead earnest."</p>

<p>"You know what'll happen to you if you lose?"
queried Barry.</p>

<p>"Yes. And I know Foley may not even give me
a chance to lose," Tom added grimly.</p>

<p>"You've got nerve to burn, Tom," said Pig Iron.
"It's not an easy proposition. Myself, I'd as soon
put on the gloves an' mix it up with the devil. An'
to spit it right out on the carpet, Tom, I think Buck's
done the union a lot o' good."</p>

<p>"You're right there, Pete. No one knows that
better than I do. As you fellows know, I left town
eight years ago and was bridging in the West four
years. I was pretty much of a kid when I went
away, but I was old enough to see the union didn't
have enough energy left to die. When I came back
and saw what Foley'd done, I thought he was the
greatest thing that ever happened. If he'd quit right
then the union'd 'a' papered the hall with his pictures.
But you know how he's changed since then. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
public knows it, too. Look how the newspapers
have been shooting it into him. I'm not fighting
Foley as he was four or five years ago, Pete, but
Foley as he is now."</p>

<p>"There's no denyin' he's so crooked now he can't
lay straight in bed," Pete admitted.</p>

<p>"We've got to get rid of him some time, haven't
we?" Tom went on.</p>

<p>"Yes," the two men conceded.</p>

<p>"Or sooner or later he'll smash the union. That's
certain. Now there's only one way to get rid of
him. That's to go out after him, and go after him
hard."</p>

<p>"But it's an awful risk for you, Tom," said Barry.</p>

<p>"Someone's got to take it if we ever get rid of
Foley."</p>

<p>"One thing's straight, anyhow," declared Pete.
"You're the best man in the union to go against
Foley."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Barry.</p>

<p>Tom did not deny it.</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. Then Pete asked:
"What's your plan?"</p>

<p>"Election comes the first meeting in March. I'm
going to run against him for walking delegate."</p>

<p>"If you care anything for my opinion," said Pete,
"here it is: You've got about as much chance as
a snowball in hell."</p>

<p>"You're away off, Pig Iron. You know as well
as I do that five-sixths of the men in the union are
against Foley. Why do they stand for him? Because
they're unorganized, and he's got them bluffed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
out. If those men got together, Foley'd be the snowball.
That's what I'm going to try to do,&mdash;get
those men in line."</p>

<p>A door opened, and Mrs. Barry looked in. "I
left my glasses somewhere in there. Will I bother
you men much if I look for 'em?"</p>

<p>"Not me," said Tom. "You can stay and listen
if you want to."</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry sat down. "I suppose you don't mind
tellin' us how you're goin' to get the men in line,"
said Pete.</p>

<p>"My platform's going to be an honest administration
of the affairs of the union, and every man
to be treated like a man. That's simple enough,
ain't it?&mdash;and strong enough? And a demand for
more wages. I'm going to talk these things to
every man I meet. If they can kick Foley out, and
get honest management and decent treatment, just
by all coming out and voting, don't you think they're
going to do it? They'll all fall in line."</p>

<p>"That demand for more wages is a good card.
Our wage contract with the bosses expires May first,
you know. The men all want more money; they
need it; they deserve it. If I talk for it Foley'll
be certain to oppose it, and that'll weaken him.</p>

<p>"I wanted to talk this over with you fellows to
get your opinion. I thought you might suggest
something. But even if you don't like the scheme,
and even if you don't want to join in the fight, I'm
going to stick it out. My mind's made up."</p>

<p>Tom sank back into his chair and waited for the
two men to speak.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, your scheme don't sound just like an
insane asylum," Pete admitted. "Count me in."</p>

<p>Tom looked across at Barry. Barry's face was
turned down and his hands were inter-gripped.
Tom understood. Barry had been out of work much
during the last three years, and recent illness in the
family had endowed him with debts. If he actively
engaged in Tom's movement, and Foley triumphed,
Foley's vengeance would see to it that Barry worked
no more in New York. It was too great a risk to
ask of a man situated as Barry was.</p>

<p>"I understand, Barry," said Tom. "That's all
right. Don't you do it."</p>

<p>Barry made no answer.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry put her hand on her husband's
shoulder. "Jim, ain't we goin' to be in on this fight
against Foley?"</p>

<p>"You know why, Mary." There was a catch in
his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes. Because of me an' the kids. You, I
know you've got as much nerve as anybody. We're
goin' in, Jim. An' if we lose"&mdash;she tried to
smile&mdash;"why, I ain't much of a consumptive, am
I? I'll take in washin' to help out."</p>

<p>Tom turned his face about. Pete did the same,
and their eyes met. Pete's face was set hard. He
growled out something that sounded very much like
an oath.</p>

<p>It was midnight when Tom left. The strike
which Foley called on the St. Etienne Hotel the next
day gave him time for much thinking about his campaign.
He acquainted several of the more influ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>ential
members of the union with his purpose, asking
them to keep secret what he said till he was ready to
begin an open fight. All gave him sympathy, but
most of them hesitated when it came to promising
active assistance. "Now if Foley only couldn't do
us out of our jobs, in case you lose, we'd be right
with you. But&mdash;&mdash;" Fear inclined them to let bad
enough alone.</p>

<p>This set Tom to thinking again. On Monday
evening&mdash;that afternoon Foley had ordered the men
back to work on the St. Etienne Hotel&mdash;Tom announced
a new plan to Barry and Pete. "We
want to get every argument we can to use on the
boys. It struck me we might make some use of the
bosses. It's to their interest, as well as to ours, for
us to have the right sort of delegate. If we could
say that the bosses are sick of Foley and want us to
get a decent man, and will guarantee to keep us at
work no matter what Foley says,&mdash;that might have
influence on some of the weak-kneed brothers."</p>

<p>"The boys'd say the bosses ain't runnin' the
union," said Pete. "If you get the bosses on your
side, the boys'll all stand by Foley."</p>

<p>"I thought of that. That's what'd happen if we
got mixed up with anybody on the Executive Committee
of the bosses except Baxter. The boys think
Murphy, Bobbs, and Isaacs are pretty small potatoes,
and they think Driscoll's not on the square. I guess
it's a case of the pot calling the kettle black, but you
know what Foley says about Driscoll. But with
Baxter it's different. He's friendly to the union, and
the boys know it. A word from him might help a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
lot. And he hates Foley, and Foley has no use for
him. I've heard Buck say as much."</p>

<p>"It's worth tryin', anyhow," Pete and Barry
agreed.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to brace him to-morrow after
work," said Tom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">TOM SEEKS HELP FROM THE ENEMY</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idca.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="A" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">At the end of work the next day Tom
joined the rush of men down the ladders
and the narrow servants' stairways, the
only ones in as yet, and on gaining the
street made for the nearest saloon. Five cents invested
in beer secured for him the liberty of the
house. He washed himself, brushed his hair and
clothing, and set forth for the office of Baxter &amp; Co.</p></div>

<p>Baxter &amp; Co. occupied one side of the tenth floor
of a big downtown office building. Tom found himself
in a large waiting-room, divided by a wooden
railing, beyond which at a desk sat an imperious
youth in a blue uniform.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Baxter in?" Tom inquired.</p>

<p>The uniform noted that Tom's clothes were worn
and wrinkled. "He's busy," it said stiffly.</p>

<p>"Is he in?"</p>

<p>"I s'pose he is."</p>

<p>"Well, you tell him I want to see him. Keating's
my name. I'll wait if he's busy."</p>

<p>The uniform carelessly handed him a slip of paper.
"Write down yer name an' business, an' I'll see if
he'll see youse."</p>

<p>With a gleam in his eyes Tom took the printed
form, wrote his name and "on business of the Iron
Workers' Union."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>The boy accepted the slip and calmly read it.
Tom gave him a push that sent him spinning. "Get
a move on you, there! I'm in a hurry."</p>

<p>The boy gave a startled look back, and walked
quickly down an alley that ran between two rows of
offices. Tom sat down in one of the leather-bottomed
chairs and with a show of coolness, but with
inward excitement, waited his interview with Mr.
Baxter. He had never met an employer in his life,
save regarding his own work or as a member of a
strike committee. And now the first he was to meet
in a private interview was the most prominent employer
in his trade&mdash;head of the big firm of Baxter
&amp; Co., and president of the Iron Employers' Association.</p>

<p>Several minutes passed before the uniform reappeared
and led Tom into Mr. Baxter's office, a large,
airy room with red burlap walls, cherry woodwork,
cherry chairs, a long cherry table, a flat-top cherry
desk. The room was absolutely without attempt at
decoration, and was as clean as though it had been
swept and dusted the minute before. The only piece
of paper in the room was an architect's drawing of
a façade, which Mr. Baxter was examining.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter did not look up immediately. Tom,
standing with hat in hand, was impressed with his
busyness. He was not yet acquainted with the devices
by which men of affairs fortify their importance.</p>

<p>Suddenly Mr. Baxter wheeled about in his chair.
"I beg your pardon. Be seated. What can I do
for you?"</p>

<p>He was perhaps forty-five or fifty&mdash;slender, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
high, narrow brow, steely eyes, and Vandyke beard.
His neatness was equal to that of his office; he
looked as though he were fresh from barber, haberdasher
and tailor. Tom understood the success of
the man in the first glance at his face: he was as
quick to act upon the opportunity as a steel trap.</p>

<p>Tom sat down in one of the polished chairs, and
affected composure by throwing his left arm across
the cherry table. "I belong to the Iron Workers'
Union. To come right to the point&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shall be obliged if you will. I'm really very
busy."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter's tone was a model of courtesy. A
more analytical man than Tom might have felt the
distinction that it was the courtesy a gentlemen owes
himself, not the courtesy one man owes another.
Tom merely felt a vague antagonism, and that put
him at his ease.</p>

<p>"I'm busy, too," he returned quietly. "What
I've come to see you about is a matter which I consider
of great importance to the bosses and the union.
And I've come to see you because I know you are
friendly to the union."</p>

<p>"I believe that in most cases the interests of the
employers and the interests of the union are practically
the same."</p>

<p>"And also because you don't like Foley."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter fingered his narrow watch chain a
moment. "So you've come to see me about Mr.
Foley?"</p>

<p>"Yes. There's no use going into details with
you, Mr. Baxter. You know the sort Foley is as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
well as I do. He bullies the union. That's nothing
to you. But he's not on the square with the
bosses. That is. As you said awhile ago, the interests
of the bosses and the union are the same. It's
to the interest of both to get rid of Foley. That's
so, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter's face was inscrutable. "You're going
to turn him out then?"</p>

<p>"We're going to try to."</p>

<p>"And what will be your policy then?&mdash;if you
don't mind my asking it."</p>

<p>"To run things on the square."</p>

<p>"A praiseworthy purpose. Of course you'll put
in a square man as delegate then."</p>

<p>"I'm going to run myself."</p>

<p>Tom thought he saw a significant look pass across
Mr. Baxter's face. "Not because I'm anxious for
his job," he hastened to explain. "But somebody's
got to run against him."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter nodded slightly. "I see. Not a
very popular risk." His keen eyes never wavered
from Tom's face. "How do you propose to defeat
Foley? But don't tell me anything you don't
want to."</p>

<p>Tom outlined his plans for organizing the better
element against Foley.</p>

<p>"That sounds feasible," was Mr. Baxter's comment
when Tom had concluded. His eyes were
still fastened on Tom's face. "And after you win,
there'll be a strike?"</p>

<p>This question, asked quietly but with electrical
quickness, caught Tom unprepared. He floundered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
an instant. "We've got to bridge two or three
rivers before we come to that one," he answered.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter hardly moved an eyelash. "That's
obvious. And now, aside from the benefit which
we are to secure by the change, how does your plan
concern me?"</p>

<p>"Since you are going to profit by the fight, if we
win, I thought you might help us. And you can do
it easy enough. One thing that'll keep a lot of the
members from joining in the fight is that they're
afraid, if Foley wins out, he'll get 'em all fired.
Now if you'll simply guarantee that you'll stand by
the men, why, they'll all come out against Foley and
we'll beat him five to one. There'll be no chance
for us to lose."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter's white brow wrinkled in thought.
Tom waited his words in suspense. At length he
spoke.</p>

<p>"You will readily realize, Mr. Keating, that it
is an almost unprecedented step for us to take such a
part in the affairs of a union. Your suggestion is
something I must think about."</p>

<p>Tom had been certain Mr. Baxter would fall in
with his scheme enthusiastically. It required so little,
merely his word, and assured so much. Mr. Baxter's
judicial reception of his plan shot him through
with disappointment.</p>

<p>"What, don't it appeal to you?" he cried.</p>

<p>"It certainly seems full of promise."</p>

<p>"It will clear us of Foley&mdash;certain! And it is to
the interest of both of us that the union be run on
the square."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's true,&mdash;very true. But the most I can
say to you now, Mr. Keating, is that I'll take the
matter under advisement. Come to see me again
in a few days."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter began to finger the drawing on his
desk, whereby Tom knew the interview was at an
end. Greatly dashed, but somewhat reassured by
the contractor's last words, he said good-afternoon
and withdrew. The uniform respectfully opened the
gate in the railing. In the uniform's book of wisdom
it was writ down that anyone who could be
closeted with your boss was deserving of courtesy.</p>

<p>The instant the office door closed on Tom's back
Mr. Baxter quickly rose and paced the floor for
several minutes. Then he sat down at his desk, took
a sheet of paper from a drawer, and dashed off a
note to Foley.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter did not rise to greet Foley when the
walking delegate entered his office the next afternoon.
"Mr. Foley," he said, with a short nod of
his head.</p>

<p>"Youse guessed my name," said Foley, cooly
helping himself to a chair. "What's doin'?"</p>

<p>The two men watched each other narrowly, as
might two enemies who have established a truce, yet
who suspect treachery on the part of the other.
There was a distant superiority in the manner of Mr.
Baxter,&mdash;and also the hardly concealed strain of the
man who, from policy or breeding, would be polite
where he loathes. Foley, tilted back in his chair,
matched this manner with an air of defiant self-assertion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Baxter rapidly sketched the outline of what
Tom had said to him.</p>

<p>"And so Keating come to youse for help," grinned
Foley. "That ain't bad!"</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter did not recognize Foley's equality by
smiling. "I thought it to your interest to let you
know this at once, for&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And to your interest, too."</p>

<p>"I knew you were not particularly desirous of
having Mr. Keating elected," he continued.</p>

<p>"I'm just about as anxious as youse are," said
Foley promptly. "Anyhow," he added carelessly,
"I already knew what youse told me." Which he
did not.</p>

<p>"Then my sending for you and telling you has
served no purpose." The coldness of his voice
placed a wide distance between himself and the walking
delegate.</p>

<p>Foley perceived the distance, and took a vindictive
pleasure in bridging it with easy familiarity. "Not
at all, Baxter. It gives youse a chance to show how
much youse like me, an' how much youse've got
the interest o' the union at heart."</p>

<p>The lean, sarcastic face nettled Mr. Baxter. "I
think my reputation speaks for my interest in the
union," he said stiffly.</p>

<p>"Your interest in the union!" Foley laughed.</p>

<p>No man had ever seen Mr. Baxter lose his self-control;
but he was as near losing it now as he had
ever been, else he would not have made so weak a
rejoinder.</p>

<p>"My reputation speaks for my interest," he re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>peated.
"You won't find a man in your union but
that'll say I'm the union's friend."</p>

<p>Foley laughed again&mdash;a harsh, biting laugh.
"An' why do they say it, eh? Because I told 'em
so. An' youse've got the nerve, Baxter, to sit there
an' talk that rot to me!&mdash;me, the man that made
youse!"</p>

<p>"Made me!"</p>

<p>Foley's heart leaped to see the wrathful color flame
in the white cheek of the suave and collected Mr.
Baxter&mdash;to see the white shapely hands twitch.</p>

<p>"Yes, made youse!" And he went on with his
grim pleasure. "Youse're doin' twice the business
youse were three years ago. Why did youse get the
contracts for the Atwell building and the Sewanee
Hotel&mdash;the two jobs that put youse at the head o'
things in New York? Because Driscoll, Bobbs, an'
some o' the others had failed to get the jobs they
were workin' on done in contract time. An' why
didn't they get done on time? Because youse didn't
want 'em to get through on time. I saw that they
got bum men, who made mistakes,&mdash;an' I give 'em
their bellyful o' strikes."</p>

<p>"You didn't do these things out of love for me,"
Mr. Baxter put in meaningly. He was getting himself
in hand again.</p>

<p>"Sure, I didn't,&mdash;not any more'n youse told me
about Keating for love o' me."</p>

<p>Foley went on. "The men who want buildings
put up have found youse get through on time, an'
the others don't&mdash;so youse get the business. Why
do youse get through on time? Because I see youse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
get the fastest men in the union. An' because I see
youse don't have any labor trouble."</p>

<p>"Neither of which you do solely for love."</p>

<p>"Sure not. Now don't youse say again I haven't
made youse. An' don't give me that hot air about
bein' friendly to the union. Three years ago youse
seen clearer than the others that youse bosses was
bound to lose the strike. Youse'd been fightin' the
union till then, an' not makin' any more'n the rest o'
the bosses. So youse tried a new game. Youse led
the other bosses round to give in, an' got the credit
o' bein' a friend o' the union. I know how much
youse like the union!"</p>

<p>"Pardon me if I fail to see the purpose of all this
retrospection," said Mr. Baxter sarcastically.</p>

<p>"I just wanted to remind youse that I'm on to
youse from hair to toenails&mdash;that's all," Foley answered
calmly.</p>

<p>"I think it would be wiser to confine our conversation
to the matter in hand," said Mr. Baxter
coldly. "Mr. Keating said he was certain to beat
you. What chance does he have of being elected?"</p>

<p>"The same as youse."</p>

<p>"And a strike,&mdash;how about that?"</p>

<p>"It follows if I'm elected, don't it, there'll not
be any strike."</p>

<p>"That's according to our agreement," said Mr.
Baxter.</p>

<p>"No," said Foley, as he rose, "Keating ain't
goin' to trouble youse much." A hard look came
over his face. "Nor me."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">IN WHICH FOLEY PLAYS WITH TWO MICE</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idcf.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="F" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">Foley left Mr. Baxter's office with the
purpose of making straight for the office
of Mr. Driscoll; but his inborn desire to
play with the mouse caused him to change
the direct road to an acute angle having at its apex
the St. Etienne Hotel. He paused a moment to look
up at the great black skeleton,&mdash;a lofty scaffolding
that might have been erected for some mural painter
ambitious to fresco his fame upon the sky. He saw
the crane swing a beam to its place between two of
the outside columns, and saw a man step upon its
either end to bolt it to its place. Suddenly the crane
jerked up the beam, and the men frantically threw
their arms around it. As suddenly the crane lowered
it. It struck upon the head of a column. Foley
saw one man fly from the beam, catch hold of the
end of a board that extended over the edge of the
building, hang there; saw the beam, freed in some
manner from the pulley hook, start down, ridden by
one man; and then saw it come whirling downward
alone.</p></div>

<p>"Look out!" he shouted with all his lungs.</p>

<p>Pedestrians rushed wildly from beneath the shed
which extended, as a protection to them, over the
sidewalk. Horses were jerked rearing backwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
The black beam crashed through the shed and through
the pine sidewalk. Foley dashed inside and for the
ladder.</p>

<p>Up on the great scaffolding hands had seized
the wrists of the pendant man and lifted him to
safety. All were now leaning over the platform's
edge, gazing far down at the ragged hole in the
shed.</p>

<p>"D'you see Pete?" Tom asked at large, in a
strained voice.</p>

<p>There were several noes.</p>

<p>"That was certainly the last o' Pig Iron," muttered
one of the gang.</p>

<p>He was not disputed.</p>

<p>"It wasn't my fault," said the signalman, as
pale as paper. "I didn't give any wrong signals.
Someone below must 'a' got caught in the rope."</p>

<p>"I'm going down," said Tom; and started rapidly
for the ladder's head&mdash;to be met with an ascending
current of the sort of English story books
ascribe to pirates. Pete's body followed the words
so closely as to suggest a possible relation between
the two. Tom worked Pete's hand. The men
crowded up.</p>

<p>"Now who the"&mdash;some pirate words&mdash;"done
that?" Pete demanded.</p>

<p>"It was all an accident," Tom explained.</p>

<p>"But I might 'a' been kilt!"</p>

<p>"Sure you might," agreed Johnson sympathetically.</p>

<p>"How is it you weren't?" Tom asked.</p>

<p>"The beam, in whirlin' over, swung the end I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
was on into the floor below. I grabbed a beam
an' let it travel alone. That's all."</p>

<p>Foley, breathing deeply from his rapid climb,
emerged this instant from the flooring, and walked
quickly to the group. "Anybody kilt?" he asked.</p>

<p>The particulars of the accident were given him.
"Well, boys, youse see what happens when youse
got a foreman that ain't onto his job."</p>

<p>Tom contemptuously turned his back and walked
away.</p>

<p>"I don't see why Driscoll don't fire him," growled
Jake.</p>

<p>"Who knows what'll happen!" Foley turned a
twisted, knowing look about the group. "He's been
talkin' a lot!"</p>

<p>He walked over to where Tom stood watching the
gang about the north crane. "I'm dead onto your
game," he said, in a hard, quiet voice, his eyes
glittering.</p>

<p>Tom was startled. He had expected Foley to
learn of his plan, but thought he had guarded against
such an early discovery. "Well?" he said defiantly.</p>

<p>Foley began to play with his mouse. "I guess
youse know things'll begin to happen." He greedily
watched Tom's face for signs of inward squirming.
"Remember the little promise I made youse t'other
day? Buck Foley usually keeps his promises, don't
he&mdash;hey?"</p>

<p>But the mouse refused to be played with. "The
other beam, boys," it called out to three men, and
strode away toward them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Foley watched Tom darkly an instant, and then
turned sharply about. At the ladder's head Jake
stopped him.</p>

<p>"Get him fired, Buck. Here's your chance to
get me that foreman's job you promised me."</p>

<p>"We'll see," Foley returned shortly, and passed
down the ladder and along the other leg of the angle
to the office of Driscoll &amp; Co. He gave his name
to Miss Arnold. She brought back the message
that he should call again, as Mr. Driscoll was too
busy to see him.</p>

<p>"Sorry, miss, but I guess I'm as busy as he is.
I can't come again." And Foley brushed coolly past
her and entered Mr. Driscoll's office.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon, Mr. Driscoll," he said, showing
his yellow teeth in a smile, and helping himself
to a chair. "Nice afternoon, ain't it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll wheeled angrily about in his chair.
"I thought I sent word to you I was too busy to
see you?"</p>

<p>"So youse did, Mr. Driscoll. So youse did."</p>

<p>"Well, I meant it!" He turned back to his
desk.</p>

<p>"I s'pose so," Foley said cheerfully. He tilted
back easily in his chair, and crossed his legs. "But,
youse see, I could hardly come again, an' I wanted
very much to see youse."</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll looked as though he were going
to explode. But fits of temper at a thousand dollars
a fit were a relief that he could afford only now and
then. He kept himself in hand, though the effort
it cost him was plain to Foley.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p>"What d'you want to see me about? Be in a
hurry. I'm busy."</p>

<p>The point of Foley's tongue ran gratified between
his thin lips, as his eyes took in every squirm of this
cornered mouse. "In the first place, I come just
in a social way. I wanted to return the calls youse
made on me last week. Youse see, I been studyin'
up etiquette. Gettin' ready to break into the Four
Hundred."</p>

<p>"And in the second place?" snapped Mr. Driscoll.</p>

<p>Foley stepped to the office door, closed it, and
resumed his back-tilted seat. "In the second place,
I thought I'd like to talk over one little point about
the St. Etienne job."</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll drew a check-book out of a pigeon-hole
and dipped his pen. "How much this time?"</p>

<p>The sarcasm did not touch Foley. He made a
wide negative sweep with his right arm. "What
I'm goin' to tell youse won't cost youse a cent. It's
as free as religion." The point of red again slipped
between his lips.</p>

<p>"Well?&mdash;I said I was busy."</p>

<p>"Well, here it is: Don't youse think youse got a
pretty bum foreman on the St. Etienne job?"</p>

<p>"What business is that of yours?"</p>

<p>"Won't youse talk in a little more of a Christian
spirit, Mr. Driscoll?"</p>

<p>It was half a minute before Mr. Driscoll could
speak in any kind of a spirit. "Will you please come
to the point!"</p>

<p>"Why, I'm there already," the walking delegate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
returned sweetly. "As I was sayin', don't youse
think your foreman on the St. Etienne job is a pretty
bum outfit?"</p>

<p>"Keating?&mdash;I never had a better."</p>

<p>"D'youse think so? Now I was goin' to suggest,
in a friendly way, that youse get another man in his
place."</p>

<p>"Are you running my business, or am I?"</p>

<p>"If youse'd only talk with a little more Christian&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The eyes clicked. The members of the church to
which Mr. Driscoll belonged would have stuffed
fingers into their horrified ears at the language in
which Foley was asked to go to a place that was
being prepared for him.</p>

<p>Foley was very apologetic. "I'm too busy now,
an' I don't get my vacation till August. Then
youse ain't goin' to take my advice?"</p>

<p>"No! I'm not!"</p>

<p>The walking delegate stopped purring. He leaned
forward, and the claws pushed themselves from out
their flesh-pads. "Let's me and youse make a little
bet on that, Mr. Driscoll. Shall we say a thousand
a side?"</p>

<p>Driscoll's eyes and Foley's battled for a moment.
"And if I don't do it?" queried Mr. Driscoll,
abruptly.</p>

<p>"I don't like to disturb youse by talkin' about
unpleasant things. It would be too bad if you didn't
do it. Youse really couldn't afford any more delays
on the job, could youse?"</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll made no reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Foley stood up, again purring. "It's really good
advice, ain't it? I'll send youse round a good man
in the mornin' to take his place. Good-by."</p>

<p>As Foley passed out Mr. Driscoll savagely brushed
the papers before him to one side of his desk, crushing
them into a crumpled heap, and sat staring into
the pigeon-holes. He sent for Mr. Berman, who
after delivering an opinion in favor of Foley's proposition,
departed for his own office, pausing for a
moment to lean over the desk of the fair secretary.
Presently, with a great gulp, Mr. Driscoll touched
a button on his desk and Miss Arnold appeared
within the doorway. She was slender, but not too
slender. Her heavy brown hair was parted in the
middle and fell over either end of her low, broad
forehead. The face was sensitive, sensible, intellectual.
Persons chancing into Mr. Driscoll's office
for the first time wondered how he had come by such
a secretary.</p>

<p>"Miss Arnold, did you ever see a jelly fish?"
he demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, here's another."</p>

<p>"I can't say I see much family resemblance,"
smiled Miss Arnold.</p>

<p>"It's there, all right. We ain't got any nerve."</p>

<p>"It seems to me you are riding the transmigration
of soul theory at a pretty hard pace, Mr. Driscoll.
Yesterday, when you upset the bottle of ink, you were
a bull in a china shop, you know."</p>

<p>"When you know me a year or two longer, you'll
know I'm several sorts of dumb animals. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
didn't call you to give you a natural history lecture.
Get Duffy on the 'phone, will you, and tell him to
send Keating around as soon as he can. Then come
in and take some letters that I want you to let me
have just as quick as you can get them off."</p>

<p>Two hours later Tom appeared in Miss Arnold's
office. She had seen him two or three times when he
had come in on business, and had been struck by his
square, open face and his confident bearing. She
now greeted him with a slight smile. "Mr. Driscoll
is waiting for you," she said; and sent him
straight on through the next door.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll asked Tom to be seated and continued
to hold his bulging eyes on a sheet of paper
which he scratched with a pencil. Tom, with a sense
of impending disaster, sat waiting for his employer to
speak.</p>

<p>At length Mr. Driscoll wheeled about abruptly.
"What d'you think of Foley?"</p>

<p>"I've known worse men," Tom answered, on his
guard.</p>

<p>"You must have been in hell, then! You think
better of him than I do. And better than he thinks
of you. He's just been in to see me. He wants me
to fire you."</p>

<p>Tom had half-guessed this from the moment Duffy
had told him Mr. Driscoll wanted him, but nevertheless
he was startled by its announcement in words.
He let several seconds pass, the while he got hold of
himself, then asked in a hard voice: "And what
are you going to do?"</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll knew what he was going to do, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
his temper insisted on gratification before he told his
plan. "What can I do?" he demanded testily. "It's
your fault&mdash;the union's fault. And I don't have any
sympathy to waste for anything that happens to any
of you. Why don't you put a decent man in as your
business agent?"</p>

<p>Tom passed all this by. "So you're going to fire
me?"</p>

<p>"What else can I do?" Mr. Driscoll reiterated.</p>

<p>"Hasn't my work been satisfactory?"</p>

<p>"It isn't a question of work. If it's any satisfaction
to you, I'll say that I never had a foreman
that got as much or as good work out of the men."</p>

<p>"Then you're firing me because Foley orders you
to?" There were both pity and indignation in Tom's
voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll had expected to put his foreman on
the defensive; instead, he found himself getting on
that side. "If you want it right out, that's it. But
what can I do? I'm held up."</p>

<p>"Do?" Tom stood up before his employer, neck
and face red, eyes flashing. "Why, fight him!"</p>

<p>"I've tried that"&mdash;sarcastically&mdash;"thanks."</p>

<p>"That's what's the matter with you bosses! You
think more of dollars than you do of self-respect!"</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll trembled. "Young man, d'you know
who you're talking to?"</p>

<p>"I do!" Tom cried hotly. "To the man who's
firing me because he's too cowardly to stand up for
what's right!"</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll glared, his eyes clicked. Then he
gave a great swallow. "I guess you're about right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
But if I understand the situation, I guess there's a
lot of men in your union that'd rather hold their jobs
than stand up for what's right."</p>

<p>Tom, in his turn, had his fires drawn. "And I
guess you're about right, too," he had to admit.</p>

<p>"I may be a coward," Mr. Driscoll went on, "but
if a man puts a gun to my head and says he'll pull
the trigger unless I do what he says, I've got to do it,
that's all. And I rather guess you would, too. But
let's pass this by. I've got a plan. Foley can make
me put you off one job, but he can't make me fire you.
Let's see; I'm paying you thirty a week, ain't I?"</p>

<p>"That's it."</p>

<p>"Well, I'm going to give you thirty-five a week
and put you to work in the shop as a superintendent.
Foley can't touch you there,&mdash;or me either. Isn't
that all right?" Mr. Driscoll wore a look of half-hearted
triumph.</p>

<p>Tom had regarded Mr. Driscoll so long with dislike
that even this proposal, apparently uttered in
good faith, made him suspicious. He began to search
for a hidden motive.</p>

<p>"Well?" queried Mr. Driscoll impatiently.</p>

<p>He could find no dishonest motive. "But if I
took the job I'd have to go out of the union," he said
finally.</p>

<p>"It oughtn't break your heart to quit Foley's company."</p>

<p>Tom walked to the window and looked meditatively
into the street. Mr. Driscoll's offer was tempting.
It was full of possibilities that appealed to his
ambition. He was confident of his ability to fill this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
position, and was confident that he would develop
capacity to fill higher positions. This chance would
prove the first of a series of opportunities that would
lead him higher and higher,&mdash;perhaps even to Mr.
Driscoll's own desk. He knew he had it in him.
And the comfort, even the little luxuries, the broader
opportunities for self-development that would be his,
all appealed to him. And he was aware of the joy
this new career would give to Maggie. But to leave
the union&mdash;to give up the fight&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>He turned back to Mr. Driscoll. "I can't do it."</p>

<p>"What!" cried the contractor in amazement.</p>

<p>"I can't do it," Tom repeated.</p>

<p>"Do you know what you're throwing away? If
you turned out well, and I know you would, why
there'd be no end of chances for advancement.
I've got a lot of weak men on my pay-roll."</p>

<p>"I understand the chance, Mr. Driscoll. But I
can't take it. Do you know why Foley's got it in for
me?"</p>

<p>"He don't like you, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Because he's found out, somehow, that I've begun
a fight on him, and am going to try to put him out of
business. If I take this job, I've got to drop the
fight. And I'll never do that!" Tom was warming
up again. "Do you know the sort Foley is?
I suppose you know he's a grafter?"</p>

<p>"Yes. So does my pocket-book."</p>

<p>"And so does his pocket-book. His grafting alone
is enough to fight him on. But there's the way he
treats the union! You know what he's done to me.
Well, he's done that to a lot of others. He's got<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
some of us scared so we're afraid to breathe. And
the union's just his machine. Now d'you suppose I'm
going to quit the union in that shape?" He brought
his big red fist thundering down on the desk before
Mr. Driscoll. "No, by God! I'm going to stick
by the boys. I've got a few hundred saved. They'll
last me a while, if I can't get another job. And I'm
going to fight that damned skate till one of us
drops!"</p>

<p>Miss Arnold had come in the moment before with
letters for Mr. Driscoll's signature, and had stood
through Tom's outburst. She now handed the letters
to Mr. Driscoll, and Tom for the first time
noticed her presence. It struck him full of confusion.</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, miss. I didn't know you were
here. I&mdash;I hope you didn't mind what I said."</p>

<p>"If Miss Arnold objects to what you said, I'll
fire her!" put in Mr. Driscoll.</p>

<p>The secretary looked with hardly-concealed admiration
at Tom, still splendid in the dying glow of his
defiant wrath. "If I objected, I'd deserve to be
fired," she said. Then she added, smiling: "You
may say it again if you like."</p>

<p>After Miss Arnold had gone out Mr. Driscoll
looked at Tom with blinking eyes. "I suppose you
think you're some sort of a hero," he growled.</p>

<p>Tom's sudden confusion had collapsed his indignation.
"No, I'm a man looking for a job," he
returned, with a faint smile.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm glad you didn't take the job I offered
you. I can't afford to let fools help manage my
business."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom took his hat. "I suppose this is all," he
said and started for the door.</p>

<p>"Hold on!" Mr. Driscoll stood up. "Why
don't you shake hands with a man, like a gentleman?
There. That's the stuff. I want to say to you,
Keating, that I think you're just about all right. If
ever you want a job with me, just come around and
say so and I'll give you one if I have to fire myself
to make a place for you. And if your money gives
out, or you need some to use in your fight, why I ain't
throwing much away these days, but you can get all
you want by asking for it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<img src="images/idch.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="H" title=""

<p class="cap_1">His dismissal had been one of the risks
Tom had accepted when he had decided
upon war, and though he felt it keenly
now that it had come, yet its chief effect
was to intensify his resolution to overturn Buck
Foley. He strode on block after block, with his
long, powerful steps, his resolution gripping him
fiercer and fiercer,&mdash;till the thought leaped into his
mind: "I've got to tell Maggie."</p></div>

<p>He stopped as though a cold hand had been laid
against his heart; then walked on more slowly, considering
how he should give the news to her. His
first thought was to say nothing of his dismissal for
a few days. By then he might have found another
job, and the telling that he had lost one would be an
easy matter. But his second thought was that she
would doubtless learn the news from some of her
friends, and would use her tongue all the more freely
because of his attempt at concealment; and, furthermore,
he would be in the somewhat inglorious position
of the man who has been found out. He decided
to have done with it at once.</p>

<p>When he entered his flat Maggie looked up in
surprise from the tidy on which she was working.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
"What! home already!" Then she noticed his
face. "Why, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>Tom drew off his overcoat and threw it upon the
couch. "I've been fired."</p>

<p>She looked at him in astonishment. "Fired!"</p>

<p>"Yes." He sat down, determined to get through
with the scene as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>For the better part of a minute she could not
speak. "Fired? What for?" she articulated.</p>

<p>"It's Foley's work. He ordered Driscoll to."</p>

<p>"You've been talking about Foley some more,
then?"</p>

<p>"I have."</p>

<p>Tom saw what he had feared, a hard, accusing
look spread itself over her face. "And you've done
that, Tom Keating, after what I, your wife, said to
you only last week? I told you what would happen.
I told you Foley would make us suffer. I told you
not to talk again, and you've gone and done it!"
The words came out slowly, sharply, as though it
were her desire to thrust them into him one by one.</p>

<p>Tom began to harden, as she had hardened. But
at least he would give her the chance to understand
him. "You know what Foley's like. You know
some of the things he's done. Well, I've made up
my mind that we oughtn't to stand him any longer.
I'm going to do what I can to drive him out of the
union."</p>

<p>"And you've been talking this?" she cut in.
"Oh, of course you have! No wonder he got you
fired! Oh, my God! I see it all. And you, you
never thought once of your wife or your child!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>"I did, and you'll see when I tell you all," Tom
said harshly. "But would you have me stand for
all the dirty things he does?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't you keep out of his way&mdash;as I asked
you to? Because a wolf's a wolf, that's no reason
why you should jump in his mouth."</p>

<p>"It is if you can do him up. And I'm going to
do Foley up. I'm going to run against him as walking
delegate. The situation ain't so bad as you
think," he went on, with a weak effort to appease her.
"You think things look dark, but they're going to
be brighter than they ever were. I'll get another
job soon, and after the first of March I'll be walking
delegate. I'm going to beat Buck Foley, sure!"</p>

<p>For a moment the vision of an even greater elevation
than the one from which they were falling made
her forget her bitter wrath. Then it flooded back
upon her, and she put it all into a laugh. "You
beat Buck Foley! Oh, my!"</p>

<p>Her ireful words he had borne with outward
calm; he had learned they were borne more easily, if
borne calmly. But her sneering disbelief in him was
too much. He sprang up, his wrath tugging at its
leash. She, too, came to her feet, and stood facing
him, hands clenched, breast heaving, sneering, sobbing.
Her words tumbled out.</p>

<p>"Oh, you! you! Brighter days, you say. Ha!
ha! You beat Buck Foley? Yes, I know how!
Buck Foley'll not let you get a job in your trade.
You'll have to take up some other work&mdash;if you
can get it! Begin all over! We'll grow poorer
and poorer. We'll have to eat anything. I'll have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
to wear rags. Just when we were getting comfortable.
And all because you wouldn't pay any attention
to what I said. Because you were such a
fo-o-ol! Oh, my God! My God!"</p>

<p>As she went on her voice rose to a scream, broken
by gasps and sobs. At the end she passionately
jerked Tom's coat and hat from the couch and threw
herself upon it&mdash;and the frenzied words tumbled on,
and on.</p>

<p>Tom looked down upon her a moment, quivering
with wrath and a nameless sickness. Then he picked
up hat and coat, and glancing at Ferdinand, who had
shrunk terrified into a corner, walked quickly out of
the flat.</p>

<p>He strode about the streets awhile, had dinner
in a restaurant, and then, as Wednesday was the
union's meeting night, he went to Potomac Hall. It
fell out that he met Pete and Barry entering as he
came up.</p>

<p>"I guess you'll have another foreman to-morrow,
boys," he announced; and he briefly told them of his
discharge.</p>

<p>"It'll be us next, Rivet Head," said Pete.</p>

<p>Barry nodded, his face pale.</p>

<p>All the men in the hall learned that evening what
had happened to Tom, some from his friends, more
from Foley's friends. And the manner of the latter's
telling was a warning to every listener. "D'you
hear Keating has been fired?" "Fired? No.
What for?" A wise wink: "Well, he's been talkin'
about Foley, you know."</p>

<p>Tom grew hot under, but ignored, the open jeer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>ing
of the Foleyites. The sympathy of his friends
he answered with a quiet, but ominous, "Just you
wait!" There were few present of the men he had
counted on seeing, and soon after the meeting ended,
which was unusually early, he started home.</p>

<p>It was after ten when he came in. Maggie sat
working at the tidy; she did not look up or speak;
her passion had settled into resentful obstinacy, and
that, he knew from experience, only time could overcome.
He had not the least desire to assist time in
its work of subjection, and passed straight into their
bedroom.</p>

<p>Tom felt her sustained resentment, as indeed he
could not help; but he did not feel that which was the
first cause of the resentment&mdash;her lack of sympathetic
understanding of him. At twenty-three he
had come into a man's wages, and Maggie's was the
first pretty face he had seen after that. The novelty
of their married life had soon worn off, and with the
development of his stronger qualities and of her
worst ones, it had gradually come about that the
only thoughts they shared were those concerning
their common existence in their home. Tom had
long since become accustomed to carrying his real
ideas to other ears. And so he did not now consciously
miss wifely sympathy with his efforts.</p>

<p>There was no break the next morning in Maggie's
sullen resentment. After an almost wordless breakfast
Tom set forth to look for another job. An
opening presented itself at the first place he called.
"Yes, it happens we do need a foreman," said the
contractor. "What experience have you had?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom gave an outline of his course in his trade,
dwelling on the last two years and a half that he had
been a foreman.</p>

<p>"Um,&mdash;yes. That sounds very good. You say
you worked last for Driscoll on the St. Etienne
job?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I suppose you don't mind telling why you left?
Driscoll hasn't finished that job yet."</p>

<p>Tom briefly related the circumstances.</p>

<p>"So you're out with Foley." The contractor
shook his head. "Sorry. We need a man, and I
guess you're a good one. But if Foley did that to
Driscoll, he'll do the same to me. I can't afford to
be mixed up in any trouble with him."</p>

<p>This conversation was a more or less accurate
pattern of many that followed on this and succeeding
days. Tom called on every contractor of importance
doing steel construction work. None of them
cared to risk trouble with Foley, and so Tom continued
walking the streets.</p>

<p>One contractor&mdash;the man for whom he had
worked before he went on the St. Etienne job&mdash;offered
Tom what he called some "business advice."
"I'm a pretty good friend of yours, Keating, for
I've found you all on the level. The trouble with
you is, when you see a stone wall you think it was put
there to butt your head against. Now, I'm older
than you are, and had a lot more experience, and let
me tell you it's a lot easier, and a lot quicker, when
you see trouble across your path like a stone wall, to
go round it than it is to try to butt it out of your way.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Stop butting against Foley. Make up with him, or
go to some other city. Go round him."</p>

<p>In the meantime Tom was busy with his campaign
against Foley. He was discharged on the fourteenth
of February; the election came on the seventh
of March; only three weeks, so haste was necessary.
On the days he was tramping about for a
job he met many members of the union also looking
for work, and to these he talked wherever he found
them. And every night he was out talking to the
men, in the streets, in saloons, in their own homes.</p>

<p>The problem of his campaign was a simple one&mdash;to
get at least five hundred of the three thousand
members of the union to come to the hall on election
night and cast their votes against Foley. His campaign,
therefore, could have no spectacular methods
and no spectacular features. Hard, persistent work,
night after night&mdash;that was all.</p>

<p>On the evening after the meeting and on the following
evening Tom had talks with several leading
men in the union. A few joined in his plan with
spirit. But most that he saw held back; they were
willing to help him in secret, but they feared the
result of an open espousal of his cause. There
were only a dozen men, including Barry and Pete,
who were willing to go the whole way with him, and
these he formed loosely into a campaign committee.
They held a caucus and nominations for all offices
were made, Tom being chosen to run for walking
delegate and president. The presidency was unsalaried,
and during Foley's régime had become an
office of only nominal importance; all real power that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
had ever belonged to the position had been gradually
absorbed by the office of walking delegate. At the
meeting on the twenty-first Tom's ticket was formally
presented to the union, as was also Foley's.</p>

<p>Even before this the dozen were busy with a canvass
of the union. The members agreed heartily to
the plan of demanding an increase in wages, for they
had long been dissatisfied with the present scale.
But to come out against Foley, that was another matter.
Tom found, as he had expected, that his arguments
had to be directed, not at convincing the men
that Foley was bad, but at convincing them it was
safe to oppose him. Reformers are accustomed to
explain their failure by saying they cannot arouse
the respectable element to come out and vote against
corruption. They would find that even fewer would
come to the polls if the voters thereby endangered
their jobs.</p>

<p>The answers of the men in almost all cases were
the same.</p>

<p>"If I was sure I wouldn't lose my job, I'd vote
against Foley in a minute. But you know well
enough, Tom, that we have a hard enough time
getting on now. Where'd we be if Foley blacklisted
us?"</p>

<p>"But there's no danger at all, if enough of us
come out," Tom would reply. "We can't lose."</p>

<p>"But you can't count on the boys coming out.
And if we lose, Foley'll make us all smart. He'll
manage to find out every man that voted against
him."</p>

<p>Here was the place in which the guarantee he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
sought from Mr. Baxter would fit in. Impelled by
knowledge of the great value of this guarantee, Tom
went to see the big contractor a few days after his
first visit. The uniform traveled down the alley
between the offices and brought back word that Mr.
Baxter was not in. Tom called again and again.
Mr. Baxter was always out. Tom was sorely disappointed
by his failure to get the guarantee, but
there was nothing to do but to make the best of it;
and so he and his friends went on tirelessly with their
nightly canvassing.</p>

<p>The days, of course, Tom continued to spend in
looking for work. In wandering from contractor
to contractor he frequently passed the building in
which was located the office of Driscoll &amp; Co.; and, a
week after his discharge, as he was going by near
one o'clock, it chanced Miss Arnold was coming
into the street. They saw each other in the same
instant. Tom, with his natural diffidence at meeting
strange women, was for passing her by with a lift of
his hat. "Why, Mr. Keating!" she cried, with
a little smile, and as they held the same direction he
could but fall into step with her.</p>

<p>"What's the latest war news?" she asked.</p>

<p>"One man still out of a job," he answered, taking
refuge in an attempt at lightness. "No actual conflict
yet. I'm busy massing my forces. So far I
have one man together&mdash;myself."</p>

<p>"You ought to find that a loyal army." She was
silent for a dozen paces, then asked impulsively:
"Have you had lunch yet?"</p>

<p>Tom threw a surprised look down upon her. "Yes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Twelve o'clock's our noon hour. We men are used
to having our lunch then."</p>

<p>"I thought if you hadn't we might have lunched
in the same place," she hastened to explain, with a
slight flush of embarrassment. "I wanted to ask
you some questions. You see, since I've been in
New York I've been in a way thrown in contact
with labor unions. I've read a great deal on both
sides. But the only persons I've had a chance to
talk to have all been on the employers' side,&mdash;persons
like Mr. Driscoll and my uncle, Mr. Baxter."</p>

<p>"Baxter, the contractor&mdash;Baxter &amp; Co.?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>Tom wondered what necessity had forced the
niece of so rich a man as Mr. Baxter to earn her
living as a stenographer.</p>

<p>"I've often wanted to talk with some trade union
man, but I've never had the chance. I thought you
might tell me some of the things I want to know."</p>

<p>The note of sincere disappointment in Miss
Arnold's voice brought a suggestion to Tom's mind
that both embarrassed and attracted. He was not
accustomed to the society of women of Miss Arnold's
sort, whose order of life had been altogether different
from his own, and the idea of an hour alone with her
filled him with a certain confusion. But her freshness
and her desire to know more of the subject that was
his whole life allured him; and his interest was
stronger than his embarrassment. "For that matter,
I'm not busy, as you know. If you would like
it, I can talk to you while you eat."</p>

<p>For the next hour they sat face to face in the quiet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
little restaurant to which Miss Arnold had led the
way. The other patrons found themselves looking
over at the table in the corner, and wondering what
common subject could so engross the refined young
woman in the tailored gown and the man in ill-fitting
clothes, with big red hands, red neck and crude,
square face. For their part these two were unconscious
of the wondering eyes upon them. With a
query now and then from Miss Arnold, Tom spiritedly
presented the union side of mooted questions
of the day,&mdash;the open shop, the strike, the sympathetic
strike, the boycott. The things Miss Arnold
had read had dealt coldly with the moral and economic
principles involved in these questions. Tom
spoke in human terms; he showed how every point
affected living men, and women, and children. The
difference was the difference between a treatise and
life.</p>

<p>Miss Arnold was impressed,&mdash;not alone by what
Tom said, but by the man himself. The first two or
three times she had seen him, on his brief visits to
the office, she had been struck only by a vague bigness&mdash;a
bigness that was not so much of figure as
of bearing. On his last visit she had been struck
by his bold spirit. She now discovered the crude,
rugged strength of the man: he had thought much;
he felt deeply; he believed in the justice of his cause;
he was willing, if the need might be, to suffer for
his beliefs. And he spoke well, for his sentences,
though not always grammatical, were always vital.
He seemed to present the very heart of a thing, and
let it throb before the eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>When they were in the street again and about to
go their separate ways, Miss Arnold asked, with impulsive
interest: "Won't you talk to me again about
these things&mdash;some time?"</p>

<p>Tom, glowing with the excitement of his own
words and of her sympathetic listening, promised.
It was finally settled that he should call the following
Sunday afternoon.</p>

<p>Back at her desk, Miss Arnold fell to wondering
what sort of man Tom would be had he had four
years at a university, and had his life been thrown
among people of cultivation. His power, plus these
advantages, would have made him&mdash;something big,
to say the least. But had he gone to college he
would not now be in a trade union. And in a trade
union, Miss Arnold admitted to herself, was where
he was needed, and where he belonged.</p>

<p>Tom went on his way in the elation that comes of
a new and gratifying experience. He had never
before had so keen and sympathetic a listener. And
never before had he had speech with a woman of
Miss Arnold's type&mdash;educated, thoughtful, of broad
interests. Most of the women he had known necessity
had made into household drudges&mdash;tired and
uninteresting, whose few thoughts rarely ranged far
from home. Miss Arnold was a discovery to him.
Deep down in his consciousness was a distinct surprise
that a woman should be interested in the big
things of the outside world.</p>

<p>He was fairly jerked out of his elation, when, on
turning a corner, he met Foley face to face in front
of a skyscraper that was going up in lower Broad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>way.
It was their first meeting since Foley had
tried to have grim sport out of him on the St.
Etienne Hotel.</p>

<p>Foley planted himself squarely across Tom's path.
"Hello, Keating! How're youse? Where youse
workin' now?"</p>

<p>The sneering good-fellowship in Foley's voice set
Tom's blood a-tingling. But he tried to step to one
side and pass on. Again Foley blocked his way.</p>

<p>"I understand youse're goin' to be the next
walkin' delegate o' the union. That's nice. I s'pose
these days youse're trainin' your legs for the job?"</p>

<p>"See here, Buck Foley, are you looking for a
fight? If you are, come around to some quiet place
and I'll mix it up with you all you want."</p>

<p>"I don't fight a man till he gets in my class."</p>

<p>"If you don't want to fight, then get out of my
way!"</p>

<p>With that Tom stepped forward quickly and
butted his hunched-out right shoulder against Foley's
left. Foley, unprepared, swung round as though
on a pivot. Tom brushed by and continued on his
way with unturned head.</p>

<p>Again the walking delegate proved that he could
swear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE COWARD</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idct.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">Two days before his meeting with Miss
Arnold Tom had been convinced that
any more time was wasted that was spent
in looking for a job as foreman. He
had before him the choice of being idle or working
in the gang. He disliked to do the latter,
regarding it as a professional relapse. But he was
unwilling to draw upon his savings, if that could be
avoided, so he decided to go back into the ranks.
The previous evening he had heard of three new jobs
that were being started. The contractors on two of
them he had seen during the morning; and after
his encounter with Foley he set out to interview the
third. The contractor was an employer of the smallest
consequence&mdash;a florid man with little cunning eyes.
"Yes, I do need some men," he replied to Tom's
inquiry. "How much d'you want?"</p></div>

<p>"Three seventy-five a day, the regular rate."</p>

<p>The contractor shook his head. "Too much. I
can only pay three."</p>

<p>"But you signed an agreement to pay the full
rate!" Tom cried.</p>

<p>"Oh, a man signs a lot o' things."</p>

<p>Tom was about to turn away, when his curiosity
got the better of his disgust. For a union man to
work under the scale was an offense against the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
union. For an employer to pay under the scale was
an offense against the employers' association. Tom
decided to draw the contractor out. "Well, suppose
I go to work at three dollars, how do we keep
from being discovered?" he asked.</p>

<p>The little eyes gleamed with appreciation of their
small cunning. "I make this agreement with all
my men: You get the full amount in your envelope
Saturday. Anybody that sees you open your envelope
sees that you're gettin' full scale. Then you
hand me back four-fifty later. That's for money I
advanced you durin' the week. D'you understand?"</p>

<p>"I do," said Tom. "But I'm no three dollar
man!"</p>

<p>"Hold on!" the contractor cried to Tom's back.
His cunning told him in an instant that he had made
a mistake; that this man, if let go, might make trouble.
"I was just foolin' you. Of course, I'll pay
you full rate."</p>

<p>Tom knew the man was lying, but he had no real
proof that the contractor was breaking faith both
with the union and his fellow employers; so, as he
needed the money, he took the offered position and
went to work the next morning. The job was a fire-engine
house just being started on the upper west
side of the island. The isolation of the job and the
insignificance of the contractor made Tom feel there
was a chance Foley might overlook him for the next
two weeks.</p>

<p>On the following Saturday morning three new
men began work on the job. One of them Tom was
certain he knew&mdash;a tall, lank fellow, chiefly knobs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
and angles, with wide, drooping shoulders and a big
yellow mustache. Tom left his place at the crane
of the jimmy derrick and ran down a plank into the
basement to where this man and four others were
rolling a round column to its place.</p>

<p>He touched the man on the shoulder. "Your
name's Petersen, ain't it?"</p>

<p>"Yah," said the big fellow.</p>

<p>"And you worked for a couple of days on the St.
Etienne Hotel?"</p>

<p>"Yah."</p>

<p>Tom did his duty as prescribed by the union rules.
He pointed out Petersen as a scab to the steward.
Straightway the men crowded up and there was a
rapid exchange of opinions. Tom and the steward
wanted that a demand for Petersen's discharge be
made of the contractor. But the others favored
summary action, and made for where the big Swede
was standing.</p>

<p>"Get out!" they ordered.</p>

<p>Petersen glowered at the crowd. "I lick de whole
bunch!" he said with slow defiance.</p>

<p>The men were brought to a pause by his threatening
attitude. His resentful eyes turned for an
instant on Tom. The men began to move forward
cautiously. Then the transformation that had taken
place on the St. Etienne Hotel took place again.
The courage faded from him, and he turned and
started up the inclined plank for the street.</p>

<p>Jeers broke from the men. Caps and greasy
gloves pelted Petersen's retreating figure. One man,
the smallest of the gang, ran up the plank after him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Do him up, Kid!" the men shouted scrambling
up to the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Kid, with showy valiance, aimed an upward blow
at the Swede's head. Petersen warded off the fist
with automatic ease, but made no attempt to strike
back. He started away, walking sidewise, one eye
on his path, one on his little assailant who kept
delivering fierce blows that somehow failed to reach
their mark.</p>

<p>"If he ain't runnin' from Kid!" ejaculated the
men. "Good boy, Kid!"</p>

<p>The blows became faster and fiercer. At the corner
Petersen turned back, held his foe at bay an
instant, and a second time Tom felt the resentment
of his eyes. Then he was driven around the corner.
A minute later the little man came back, puffed out
and swaggering.</p>

<p>"What an infernal coward!" the men marveled,
as they went back to work.</p>

<p>That was a hard evening for Tom. He not only
had to work for votes, but he met two or three lieutenants
who were disheartened by the men's slowness
to promise support, and to these friends he had to
give new courage. Twice, as he was talking to men
on the street, he glimpsed the tall, lean figure of
Petersen, standing in a doorway as though waiting
for someone.</p>

<p>The end of his exhausting evening's work found
him near the Barrys', and he dropped in for an
exchange of experiences. Barry and Pig Iron
Pete had themselves come in but a few minutes
before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>

<p>"Got work on your job for a couple more men?"
asked Pete after the first words had been spoken.</p>

<p>"Hello! You haven't been fired?"</p>

<p>"That's it," answered Pete; and Barry nodded.</p>

<p>"Foley's work, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Foley put Jake Henderson up to it. Oh,
Jake makes a hot foreman! Driscoll ought to pay
him ten a day to keep off the job. Jake complained
against us an' got us fired. Said we didn't know our
business."</p>

<p>"Well, it's only for another week, boys," Tom
cheered them.</p>

<p>"If you think that then you've had better luck
with the men than me 'n' Barry has," Pete declared
in disgust. "They're a bunch o' old maids!
Foley's too good for 'em. I don't see why we
should try to force 'em to take somethin' better."
The whole blankety-blanked outfit had Pete's permission
to go where they didn't need a forge to heat
their rivets.</p>

<p>"You don't understand 'em, Pete," returned Tom.
"They've got to think first of all of how to earn a
living for their families. Of course they're going
to hesitate to do anything that will endanger their
chance to earn a living. And you seem to forget
that we've only got to get one man in five to win
out."</p>

<p>"An' we've got to get him!" said Barry, almost
fiercely.</p>

<p>"D'you think there's much danger of your losin',
Tom?" Mrs. Barry queried anxiously.</p>

<p>"Not if we work. But we've got to work."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Mrs. Barry was silent for several moments, during
which the talk of the men ran on. Suddenly,
she broke in: "Don't you think the women'd have
some influence with their husbands?"</p>

<p>Tom was silent for a thoughtful minute. "Some
of them, mebbe."</p>

<p>"More'n you think, I bet!" Mrs. Barry declared.
"It's worth tryin', anyhow. Here's what I'm goin'
to do: I'm goin' to start out to-morrow an' begin
visitin' all the union women I know. I can get the
addresses of others from them. An' I'll keep at it
every afternoon I can get away till the election. I'll
talk to 'em good an' straight an' get 'em to talk to
other women. An' we'll get a lot o' the men in line,
see if we don't!"</p>

<p>Tom looked admiringly at Mrs. Barry's homely
face, flushed with determination. "The surest thing
we can do to win is to put you up for walking delegate.
I'll hustle for you."</p>

<p>"Oh, g'wan with you, Tom!" She smiled with
pleasure, however. "I've got a picture o' myself
climbin' up ladders an' buyin' drinks for the men."</p>

<p>"If you was the walkin' delegate," said Pete,
"we'd always work on the first floor, an' never drink
nothin' but tea."</p>

<p>"You shut up, Pete!" Mrs. Barry looked at
Tom. "I suppose you're wife'll help in this, too?"</p>

<p>Tom looked steadily at the scroll in Mrs. Barry's
red rug. "I'm afraid not," he said at length. "She&mdash;she
couldn't stand climbing the stairs."</p>

<p>It was after eleven o'clock when Tom left the
Barrys' and started through the quiet cross street<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
toward a car line. A man stepped from an adjoining
doorway, and fell in a score of paces behind him.
Tom heard rapid steps drawing nearer and nearer,
but it was not till the man had gained to within
a pace that it occurred to him perhaps he was being
followed. Then it was too late. His arm was
seized in a grip of steel.</p>

<p>The street was dark and empty. Thoughts of
Foley's entertainment committee flashed through his
head. He whirled about and struck out fiercely with
his free arm. His wrist was caught and held by a
grip like the first. He was as helpless as if handcuffed.</p>

<p>"I vant a yob," a savage voice demanded.</p>

<p>Tom recognized the tall, angular figure. "Hello,
Petersen! What d'you want?"</p>

<p>"I vant a yob."</p>

<p>"A job. How can I give you a job?"</p>

<p>"You take to-day ma yob avay. You give me a
yob!"</p>

<p>In a flash Tom understood. The Swede held him
accountable for the incident of the morning, and was
determined to force another job from him. Was
the man crazy? At any rate 'twould be wiser to
parley than to bring on a conflict with one possessed
of such strength as those hands betokened. So he
made no attempt to break loose.</p>

<p>"I can't give you a job, I say."</p>

<p>"You take it avay!" the Swede said, with fierce
persistence. "You make me leave!"</p>

<p>"It's your own fault. If you want to work, why
don't you get into the union?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom felt a convulsive shiver run through the
man's big frame. "De union? Ah, de union!
Ev'ryvare I ask for yob. Ev'ryvare! 'You b'long
to union?' de boss say. 'No,' I say. De boss give
me no yob. De union let me not vork! De
union&mdash;&mdash;!" His hands gripped tighter in his impotent
bitterness.</p>

<p>"Of course the union won't let you work."</p>

<p>"Vy? I am strong!&mdash;yes. I know de vork."</p>

<p>Tom felt that no explanation of unionism, however
lucid, would quiet this simple-minded excitement.
So he said nothing.</p>

<p>"Vy should I not vork? Dare be yobs. I
know how to vork. But no! De union! I mak
dis mont' two days. I mak seven dollar. Seven
dollar!" He fairly shook Tom, and a half sob
broke from his lips. "How de union tank I live?
My family?&mdash;me? Seven dollar?"</p>

<p>Tom recognized with a thrill that which he was
hearing. It was the man's soul crying out in resentment
and despair.</p>

<p>"But you can't blame the union," he said weakly,
feeling that his answer did not answer.</p>

<p>"You tank not?" Petersen cried fiercely. "You
tank not?" He was silent a brief space, and his
breath surged in and out as though he had just
paused from running. Suddenly he freed Tom's
wrists and set his right hand into Tom's left arm.
"Come! I show you vot de union done."</p>

<p>He started away. Those iron fingers locked about
the prisoner's arm were a needless fetter. The
Swede's despairing soul, glimpsed for a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
had thrown a spell upon Tom, and he would have
followed willingly.</p>

<p>Their long strides matched, and their heel-clicks
coincided. Both were silent. At the end of ten
minutes they were in a narrow street, clifted on its
either side with tenements that reached up darkly.
Presently the Swede turned down a stairway, sentineled
by garbage cans. Tom thought they were
entering a basement. But Petersen walked on, and
in the solid blackness Tom was glad of the hand
locked on his arm. They mounted a flight of stone
steps, and came into a little stone-paved court. Far
above there was a roof-framed square of stars.
Petersen led the way across the court and into the
doorway of a rear tenement. The air was rotting.
They went up two flights of stairs, so old that the
wood shivered under foot. Petersen opened a door.
A coal oil lamp burned on an otherwise barren table,
and beside the table sat a slight woman with a quilt
drawn closely about her.</p>

<p>She rose, the quilt fell from her shoulders, and she
stood forth in a faded calico wrapper. "Oh, Nels!
You've come at last!" she said. Then she saw
Tom, and drew back a step.</p>

<p>"Yah," said Petersen. He dragged Tom after
him into the room and swept his left arm about.
"See!&mdash;De union!"</p>

<p>The room was almost bare. The table, three
wooden chairs, a few dishes, a cooking-stove without
fire,&mdash;this was the furniture. Half the plastering
was gone from the ceiling, the blue kalsomine was
scaling leprously from the walls, in places the floor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
was worn almost through. In another room he saw
a child asleep on a bed.</p>

<p>There was just one picture on the walls, a brown-framed
photograph of a man in the dress and pose of
a prize fighter&mdash;a big, tall, angular man, with a
drooping mustache. Tom gave a quick glance at
Petersen.</p>

<p>"See!&mdash;De union!" Petersen repeated fiercely.</p>

<p>The little woman came quickly forward and laid
her hand on Petersen's arm. "Nels, Nels," she
said gently.</p>

<p>"Yah, Anna. But he is de man vot drove me
from ma yob."</p>

<p>"We must forgive them that despitefully use us,
the Lord says."</p>

<p>Petersen quieted under her touch and dropped
Tom's arm.</p>

<p>She turned her blue eyes upon Tom in gentle
accusation. "How could you? Oh, how could
you?"</p>

<p>Tom could only answer helplessly: "But why
don't he join the union?"</p>

<p>"How can he?"</p>

<p>The words echoed within Tom. How could he?
Everything Tom saw had not the value of half the
union's initiation fee.</p>

<p>There was an awkward silence. "Won't you sit
down, brother." Mrs. Petersen offered Tom one of
the wooden chairs, and all three sat down. He
noted that the resentment was passing from Petersen's
eyes, and that, fastened on his wife, they were
filling with submissive adoration.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nels has tried very hard," the little woman said.
They had been in the West for three years, she went
on; Nels had worked with a non-union crew on a
bridge over the Missouri. When that job was finished
they had spent their savings coming to New
York, hearing there was plenty of work there.
"We had but twenty dollars when we got here.
How could Nels join the union? We had to live.
An' since he couldn't join the union, the union
wouldn't let him work. Brother, is that just? Is
that the sort o' treatment you'd like to get?"</p>

<p>Tom was helpless against her charges. The
union was right in principle, but what was mere correctness
of principle in the presence of such a
situation?</p>

<p>"Would you be willing to join the union?" he
asked abruptly of Petersen.</p>

<p>It was Petersen's wife who answered. "O'
course he would."</p>

<p>"Well, don't you worry any more then. He
won't have any trouble getting a job."</p>

<p>"How?" asked the little woman.</p>

<p>"I'm going to get him in the union."</p>

<p>"But that costs twenty-five dollars."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But, brother, we haven't got <i>one</i>!"</p>

<p>"I'll advance it. He can pay it back easy enough
afterwards."</p>

<p>The little woman rose and stood before Tom.
Her thin white face was touched up faintly with
color, and tears glistened in her eyes. She took
Tom's big red hand in her two frail ones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>"Brother, if you ain't a Christian, you've got a
Christian heart!" she cried out, and the thin hands
tightened fervently. She turned to her husband.
"Nels, what did I say! The Lord would not forget
them that remembered him."</p>

<p>Tom saw Petersen stand up, nothing in his eyes
now but adoration, and open his arms. He turned
his head.</p>

<p>For the second time Tom took note of the brown-framed
photograph, with "The Swedish Terror" in
black letters at its bottom, and rose and stood staring
at it. Presently, Mrs. Petersen drew to his side.</p>

<p>"We keep it before us to remind us what wonders
the Lord can work, bless His holy name!" she explained.
"Nels was a terrible fightin' man before
we was married an' I left the Salvation Army. A
terrible fightin' man!" Even in her awe of Petersen's
one-time wickedness Tom could detect a lurking
admiration of his prowess. "The Lord has saved
him from all that. But he has a terrible temper.
It flares up at times, an' the old carnal desire to fight
gets hold o' him again. That's his great weakness.
But we pray that God will keep him from fightin',
an' God does!"</p>

<p>Tom looked at the little woman, a bundle of religious
ardor, looked at Petersen with his big shoulders,
thought of the incident of the morning. He blinked
his eyes.</p>

<p>Tom stepped to the table and laid down a five-dollar
bill. "You can pay that back later." He
moved quickly to the door. "Good-night," he said,
and tried to escape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>But Mrs. Petersen was upon him instantly.
"Brother! Brother!" She seized his hands again
in both hers, and looked at him with glowing eyes.
"Brother, may God bless you!"</p>

<p>Tom blinked his eyes again. "Good-night," he
said.</p>

<p>Petersen stepped forward and without a word took
Tom's arm. The grasp was lighter than when they
had come up. Again Tom was glad of the guidance
of that hand as they felt their way down the shivering
stairs, and out through the tunnel.</p>

<p>"Good-night," he said once more, when they had
gained the street.</p>

<p>Petersen gripped his hand in awkward silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">RUTH ARNOLD</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idcr.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="R" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">Ruth Arnold was known among her
friends as a queer girl. Neither the new
ones in New York nor the old ones of her
birth town understood her "strange impulses."
They were constantly being shocked by
ideas and actions which they considered, to phrase
it mildly, very unusual. The friends in her old home
were horrified when she decided to become a stenographer.
Friends in both places were horrified
when, a little less than a year before, it became known
she was going to leave the home of her aunt to become
Mr. Driscoll's secretary. "What a fool!"
they cried. "If she had stayed she might have
married ever so well!" Mrs. Baxter had entreated,
and with considerable elaboration had delivered
practically these same opinions. But Ruth was obstinate
in her queerness, and had left.</p></div>

<p>However, only a few weeks before, Mrs. Baxter
had had a partial recompense for Ruth's disappointing
conduct. She had noted the growing intimacy
between Mr. Berman, who was frequently at her
house, and Ruth, and by delicate questioning had
drawn the calm statement from her niece that Mr.
Berman had asked her in marriage.</p>

<p>"Of course you said 'yes,'" said Mrs. Baxter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>Ruth had not.</p>

<p>"My child! Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't love him."</p>

<p>"What of that?" demanded her aunt, who loved
her husband. "Love will come. He is educated,
a thorough gentleman, and has money. What more
do you want in a husband? And your uncle says
he is very clever in business."</p>

<p>Thus brought to bay, Ruth had taken her aunt
into the secret that her refusal had not been final and
that Mr. Berman had given her six months in which
to make up her mind. This statement was Mrs.
Baxter's partial recompense. "Then you'll marry
him, Ruth!" she declared, and kissed her lightly.</p>

<p>Ruth understood herself no better than did her
friends. She was not conscious that she had in a
measure that rare endowment&mdash;the clear vision
which perceives the things of life in their true relation
and at their true value, plus the instinct to
act upon that vision. It was the manifestations of
this instinct that made her friends call her queer.
Her instinct, however, did not hold her in sole sway.
Her training had fastened many governing conventions
upon her, and she was not always as brave as
her inward promptings. Her actions made upon
impulse were usually in accord with this instinct.
Her actions that were the result of thought were
frequently in accord with convention.</p>

<p>It was her instinct that had impelled her to ask
Tom to call. It was convention that, on Sunday
afternoon, made her await his coming with trepidation.
She was genuinely interested in the things for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
which Tom stood, and her recent-born admiration of
him was sincere. Nevertheless his approaching visit
was in the nature of an adventure to her. This
workingman, transferred from the business world to
the social world, might prove himself an embarrassing
impossibility. Especially, she wondered, with
more than a little apprehension, how he would be
dressed. She feared a flaming necktie crawling up
his collar, and perhaps in it a showy pin; or a pair
of fancy shoes; or a vest of assertive pattern; or,
perhaps, hair oil!</p>

<p>When word was brought her by a maid that Tom
was below, she gave an order that he was to wait,
and put on her hat and jacket. She did not know
him well enough to ask him to her room. She could
not receive him in the parlor common to all the
boarding-house. Her instinctive self told her it
would be an embarrassment to him to be set amid
the gossiping crowd that gathered there on Sunday
afternoon. Her conventional self told her that, if
he were but a tenth as bad as was possible, it would
be more than an embarrassment for her to sit beside
him amid those curious eyes. The street was the
best road out of the dilemma.</p>

<p>He was sitting in the high-backed hall chair when
she came down. "Shall we not take a walk?" she
asked. "The day is beautiful for February."</p>

<p>Tom acceded gratefully. He had glanced through
the parted portières into the parlor, and his minutes
of waiting had been minutes of consternation.</p>

<p>The first thing Ruth noted when they came out
into the light of the street was that his clothes were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
all in modest taste, and she thrilled with relief.
Mixed with this there was another feeling, a glow of
pleasure that he was vindicating himself to her conventional
part.</p>

<p>Ruth lived but a few doors from Central Park.
As they started across Central Park West a big red
automobile, speeding above the legal rate, came
sweeping down upon them, tooting its arrogant warning.
Tom jerked Ruth back upon the sidewalk.
She glared at the bundled-up occupants of the scurrying
car.</p>

<p>"Don't it make you feel like an anarchist when
people do that?" she gasped.</p>

<p>"Not the bomb-throwing sort."</p>

<p>"Why not? When people do that, I've got just
one desire, and that's to throw a bomb!"</p>

<p>"What good would a bomb here or there
do? Or what harm?" Tom asked humorously.
"What's the use trying to destroy people that're
already doomed?"</p>

<p>Ruth was silent till they gained the other side of
the street. "Doomed? What do you mean?" she
then asked.</p>

<p>"Every dog has his day, you know. Them rich
people are having theirs. It's a summer day, and I
guess it's just about noon now. But it's passing."</p>

<p>Ruth had learned during her conversation with
him on the previous Tuesday that a large figurative
statement such as this was likely to have a great
many ideas behind it, so she now proceeded to lead
him to the ideas' expression. The sun, drawing good-humoredly
from his summer's store, had brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
thousands to the Park walks, and with genial presumption
had unbuttoned their overcoats. The bare
gray branches of bush and tree glinted dully in the
warm light, as if dreamfully smiling over the budding
days not far ahead. But Tom had attention for the
joy of neither the sun nor his dependents. He
thought only of what he was saying, for he had
been led to speech upon one of his dearest subjects.</p>

<p>Though he had left school at thirteen to begin
work, he had attended night school for a number of
years, had belonged to a club whose chief aim was
debating, had read a number of solid books and had
done a great deal of thinking for himself. As a
result of his reading, thinking and observation he
had come into some large ideas concerning the future
of the working class. In the past, he now said to
Ruth, classes had risen to power, served their purpose,
and been displaced by new classes stimulated by
new ideas. The capitalist class was now in power,
and was performing its mission&mdash;the development
and centralization of industries. But its decline
would be even more rapid than its rise. It would
be succeeded by the working class. The working
class was vast in numbers, and was filled with surging
energy. Its future domination was certain.</p>

<p>"And you believe this?" Ruth queried when he
came to a pause.</p>

<p>"I know it."</p>

<p>"Admitting that all these things are coming
about&mdash;which I don't&mdash;don't you honestly think it
would be disastrous to the general interest for the
workingman to come into power?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>"You mean we would legislate solely in our own
interests? What if we did? Hasn't every class
that ever came into power done that? Anyhow,
since we make up nine-tenths of the people we'd certainly
be legislating in the interests of the majority&mdash;which
can't always be said now. And as for our
ability to run things, I'd rather have an honest fool
than a grafter that knows it all. But if you mean
we're a pretty rough lot, and haven't much education,
I guess you're about right. How can we help it?
We've never had a chance to be anything else. But
think what the working class was a hundred years
ago! Haven't we come up? Thousands of miles!
That's because we've been getting more and more
chances, like chances for an education, that used to
belong only to the rich. And our chances are increasing.
Another hundred years and we won't
know ourselves. We'll be fit for anything!"</p>

<p>"I see you're very much of a dreamer."</p>

<p>"Dreamer? Not at all! If you were to look
ahead and say in a hundred years from now it'll be
2000, would you call that a dream?"</p>

<p>"Hardly!" Ruth admitted with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well, what I'm telling you is just as certain as
the passage of time. I'm anything but a dreamer.
I believe in a present for the working class as well
as a future. I believe that we, if we work hard, have
the right, now, to-day, to a comfortable living, and
with enough over to give our children as good an
education as the children of the bosses; and with
enough to buy a few books, see a little of the world,
and to save a little so we'll not have ahead of us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
the terrible fear that we and our families may starve
when we get too old to work. That's the least we
ought to have. But we lack an almighty lot of
having it, Miss Arnold.</p>

<p>"Take my own trade&mdash;and we're a lot better off
than most workingmen&mdash;we get three seventy-five
a day. That wouldn't be so bad if we made it three
hundred days a year, but you know we don't average
more than six months' work. Less than seven
hundred dollars a year. What can a man with a
family do in New York on seven hundred dollars
a year? Two hundred for rent, three hundred for
food, one hundred for clothes. There's six hundred
gone in three lumps. Twenty-five cents a day left
for heat, light, education, books, amusement, travel,
street-car fare,&mdash;and to save for your old age!</p>

<p>"And then our trade's dangerous. I think half
of our men are killed. If you saw the obituary list
that's published monthly of all the branches of our
union in the country, you'd think so, too! Every
other name&mdash;crushed, or something broke and he
fell. Only the other day on a steel bridge near
Pittsburg a piece of rigging snapped and ten men
dropped two hundred feet. They landed on steel
beams in a barge anchored below&mdash;and were pulp.
And after the other names, it's pneumonia or consumption.
D'you know what that means? It means
exposure at work. Killed by their work!...
Well, that's our work,&mdash;and we get seven hundred
a year!</p>

<p>"And then our work takes the best part of our
lives, and throws us away. So long as we're strong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
and active, we can be used. But the day we begin
to get a little stiff&mdash;if we last that long!&mdash;we're out
of it. It may be at forty. We've got to learn how
to do something else, or just wait for the end.
There's our families. And you know how much
we've got in the bank!</p>

<p>"Well, that's how it is in our union. Is seven
hundred a year enough?&mdash;when we risk our lives
every day we work?&mdash;when we're fit for work only
so long as we're young men? We're human beings,
Miss Arnold. We're men. We want comfortable
homes, we want to keep our children in school, we'd
like to save something up for the time when we can't
work. Seven hundred a year! How're we going
to do it, Miss Arnold? How're we going to
do it?"</p>

<p>Ruth looked up at his glowing set face, and
for the moment forgot she was allied to the other
side. "Demand higher wages!" her instinct answered
promptly.</p>

<p>"That's the only thing! And that's what we're
going to do! More money for the time we do
work!"</p>

<p>He said no more. Now that the stimulant of his
excited words was gone, Ruth felt her fatigue. Engrossed
by his emotions he had swung along at a
pace that had taxed her lesser stride.</p>

<p>"Shall we not sit down," she suggested; and they
found a bench on a pinnacle of rock from whence
they looked down through a criss-cross of bare
branches upon a sun-polished lagoon, and upon the
files of people curving along the paths. Tom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
removed his hat, and Ruth turning to face him took
in anew the details of his head&mdash;the strong, square,
smooth-shaven face, the broad forehead, moist and
banded with pink where his hat had pressed, the
hair that clung to his head in tight brown curls.
Looked,&mdash;and felt herself growing small, and the
men of her acquaintance growing small. And
thought.... Yes, that was it; it was his purpose
that made him big.</p>

<p>"You have kept me so interested that I've not
yet asked you about your fight against Mr. Foley,"
she said, after a moment.</p>

<p>Tom told her all that had been done.</p>

<p>"But is there no other way of getting at the men
except by seeing them one by one?" she asked.
"That seems such a laborious way of carrying on a
campaign. Can't you have mass-meetings?"</p>

<p>Tom shook his head. "In the first place it would
be hard to get the men out; they're tired when they
come home from work, and then a lot of them don't
want to openly identify themselves with us. And
in the second place Foley'd be likely to fill the hall
with his roughs and break the meeting up."</p>

<p>"But to see the men individually! And you say
there are twenty-five hundred of them. Why, that's
impossible!"</p>

<p>"Yes. A lot of the men we can't find. They're
out when we call."</p>

<p>"Why not send a letter to every member?" asked
Ruth, suggesting the plan to her most obvious.</p>

<p>"A letter?"</p>

<p>"A letter that would reach them a day or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
before election! A short letter, that drove every
point home!" She leaned toward him excitedly.</p>

<p>"Good!" Tom brought his fist down on his knee.</p>

<p>Ruth knew the money would have to come from
his pocket. "Let's see. It would cost, for stamps,
twenty-five dollars; for the letters&mdash;they could be
printed&mdash;about fifteen dollars; for the envelopes six
or seven dollars. Say forty-five or fifty dollars."</p>

<p>Fifty dollars was a great deal to Tom&mdash;saved little
by little. But he hesitated only a moment. "All
right. If we can influence a hundred men, one in
twenty-five, it'll be worth the money."</p>

<p>A thoughtful look came over his face.</p>

<p>"What is it?" Ruth asked quickly.</p>

<p>"I was thinking about the printing and other
things. Wondering how I could get away from
work to see to it."</p>

<p>"Won't you let me look after that for you?"
Ruth asked eagerly. "I look after all our printing.
I can leave the office whenever I'm not busy, you
know. It would take only a few minutes of my
time."</p>

<p>"It really wouldn't?" Tom asked hesitantly.</p>

<p>"It wouldn't be any trouble at all. And I'd be
glad to do it."</p>

<p>Tom thanked her. "I wouldn't know how to go
about a thing of that sort, anyhow, even if I could get
away from work," he admitted.</p>

<p>"And I could see to the addressing, too," Ruth
pursued.</p>

<p>He sat up straight. "There's the trouble! The
addresses!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span></p>

<p>"The addresses? Why?"</p>

<p>"There's only one list of the men and where they
live. That's the book of the secretary and treasurer."</p>

<p>"Won't he lend it to you?"</p>

<p>Tom had to laugh. "Connelly lend it to me!
Connelly's one of the best friends Foley's got."</p>

<p>"Then there's no way of getting it?"</p>

<p>"He keeps it in his office, and when he's not there
the office is locked. But we'll get it somehow."</p>

<p>"Well, then if you'll write out the letter and send
it to me in a day or two, I'll see to having it printed
right away."</p>

<p>It flashed upon Tom what a strong concluding
statement to the letter the guarantee from Mr. Baxter
would make. He told Ruth of his idea, of his attempts
to get the guarantee, and of the influence it
would have on the men.</p>

<p>"He's probably forgotten all about it," she said.
"I think I may be able to help you to get it. I can
speak to Aunt Elizabeth and have her speak to him."</p>

<p>But her quick second thought was that she could
not do this without revealing to her aunt a relation
Mrs. Baxter could not understand. "No, after all
I can't be of any use there. You might try to see
him again, and if you fail then you might write him."</p>

<p>Tom gave her a quick puzzled glance, as he had
done a few days before when she had mentioned her
relation to Mr. Baxter. She caught the look.</p>

<p>"You are wondering how it is Mr. Baxter is my
uncle," she guessed.</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted.</p>

<p>"It's very simple. All rich people have their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
poor relatives, I suppose? Mrs. Baxter and my
mother were sisters. Mr. Baxter made money. My
father died before he had a chance. After mamma
died, I decided to go to work. There was only
enough money to live a shabby-genteel, pottering
life&mdash;and I was sick of that. I have no talents, and
I wanted to be out in the world, in contact with
people who are doing real things. So I learned
stenography. A little over a year ago I came to
New York. I lived for awhile with my uncle and
aunt; they were kind, but the part of a poor relation
didn't suit me, and I made up my mind to go to work
again. They were not pleased very well; they
wanted me to stay with them. But my mind was
made up. I offered to go to work for my uncle, but
he had no place for me, and got me the position with
Mr. Driscoll. And that's all."</p>

<p>A little later she asked him for the time. His
watch showed a quarter of five. On starting out
she had told him that she must be home by five, so
she now remarked: "Perhaps we'd better be going.
It'll take us about fifteen minutes to walk back."</p>

<p>They started homeward across the level sunbeams
that were stretching themselves out beneath barren
trees and over brown lawns for their night's sleep.
As they drew near to Ruth's boarding-house they
saw a perfectly-tailored man in a high hat go up the
steps. He was on the point of ringing the bell when
he sighted them, and he stood waiting their coming.
A surprised look passed over his face when he recognized
Ruth's companion.</p>

<p>As they came up the steps he raised his hat to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Ruth. "Good-afternoon, Miss Arnold." And to
Tom he said carelessly: "Hello, Keating."</p>

<p>Tom looked him squarely in the eyes. "Hello,
Berman," he returned.</p>

<p>Mr. Berman started at the omission of the "Mr."
Tom lifted his hat to Ruth, bade her good-afternoon,
and turned away, not understanding a sudden pang
that shot into his heart.</p>

<p>Mr. Berman's eyes followed Tom for a dozen
paces. "A very decent sort&mdash;for a workingman,"
he remarked.</p>

<p>"For any sort of a man," said Ruth, with an
emphasis that surprised her. She took out her latch-key,
and they entered.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap_1">After supper, which was eaten in the
customary silence, Tom started for the
Barrys' to talk over the scheme of circularizing
the members of the union. He
met Pete coming out of the Barrys' tenement. He
joined him and, as they walked away, outlined the
new plan.</p></div>

<p>"That's what I call a mighty foxy scheme," Pete
approved. "It's a knock-out blow. It'll come
right at the last minute, an' Foley won't have time
to hit back."</p>

<p>Tom pointed out the difficulty of getting the membership
list. "You leave that to me, Tom. It's
as easy as fallin' off the twenty-third story an' hittin'
the asphalt. You can't miss it."</p>

<p>"But what kind of a deal will you make with
Connelly? He's crooked, you know."</p>

<p>"Yes, he has got pretty much of a bend to him,"
Pete admitted. "But he ain't so worse, Tom.
I've traveled a lot with him. When d'you want the
book?"</p>

<p>"We've got to get it and put it back without Connelly
knowing it's been gone. We'd have to use
it at night. Could you get it late, and take it back
the next morning?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>"That'd be runnin' mighty close. What's the
matter with gettin' it Saturday night an' usin' it
Sunday?"</p>

<p>"Sunday's pretty late, with the election coming
Wednesday. But it'll do, I guess."</p>

<p>Tom spent the evening at one corner of the dining-table
from which he had turned back the red cloth,
laboriously scratching on a sheet of ruled letter paper.
He had never written when he could avoid it. His
ideas were now clear enough, but they struggled
against the unaccustomed confinement of written
language. The words came slowly, with physical
effort, and only after crossing out, and interlining,
and crossing out again, were they joined into
sentences.</p>

<p>At ten o'clock Maggie, who had been calling on a
friend, came in with Ferdinand. The boy made
straight for the couch and was instantly asleep.
Maggie was struck at once by the unwonted sight of
her husband writing, but her sulkiness fought her
curiosity for more than a minute, during which she
removed her hat and jacket, before the latter could
gain a grudged victory. "What are you doing?"
she asked shortly.</p>

<p>"Writing a letter," he answered, keeping his eyes
on the paper.</p>

<p>She leaned over his shoulder and read a few lines.
Her features stiffened. "What're you going to do
with that?"</p>

<p>"Print it."</p>

<p>"But you'll have to pay for it."</p>

<p>"Yes."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>"How much?"</p>

<p>"About fifty dollars."</p>

<p>She gasped, and her sullen composure fled. "Fifty
dollars! For that&mdash;that&mdash;&mdash;" Breath failed her.</p>

<p>Tom looked around. Her black eyes were blazing.
Her hands were clenched. Her full breast
was rising and falling rapidly.</p>

<p>"Tom Keating, this is about the limit!" she broke
out. "Hain't your foolishness learnt you anything
yet? It's cost you seven dollars a week already.
And here you are, throwing fifty dollars away all in
one lump! Fifty dollars!" Her breath failed her
again. "That's like you! You'll throw money
away, and let me go without a decent rag to my
back!"</p>

<p>Tom arose. "Maggie," he said, in a voice that
was cold and hard, "I don't expect any sympathy
from you. I don't expect you to understand what
I'm about. I don't think you want to understand.
But I do expect you to keep still, if you've got nothing
better to say than you've just said!"</p>

<p>Maggie had lost herself. "Is that a threat?"
she cried furiously. "Do you mean to threaten me?
Why, you brute! D'you think you can make me keep
still? You throw away money that's as much mine
as yours!&mdash;you make me suffer for it!&mdash;and yet you
expect me never to say a word, do you?"</p>

<p>Tom glared at her. His hands tingled to lay hold
of her and shake her. But, as he glared, he thought
of the woman he had so recently left, and a sense of
shame for his desire crept upon him. And, too,
he began vaguely to feel, what it was inevitable he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
should some time feel, the contrast between his
wife ... and this other.</p>

<p>His silence added to her frenzy. "You threaten
me? What do I care for your threats! You can't
do anything worse than you already have done,&mdash;and
are doing. You're ruining us! Well, what are you
standing there for? Why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>There was but one thing for Tom to do, that
which he had often had to do before,&mdash;go into the
street. He put the scribbled sheets into his coat, and
left her standing there in the middle of the floor
pouring out her fury.</p>

<p>He walked about till he thought she would be
asleep, then returned. A glance into their bedroom
showed her in bed, and Ferdinand in his cot at the
bed's foot. He sat down again at the table and resumed
his clumsy pencil.</p>

<p>It was midnight before the two-hundred-word production
was completed and copied. He put it into an
envelope, enclosed a note saying he expected to have
the list of names over the following Sunday, and took
the letter down and dropped it into a mail-box.
Then removing shoes, coat, and collar, he lay down
on the sofa with his overcoat for covering, and
presently fell asleep.</p>

<p>Ruth's heart sank when she received the letter the
next afternoon. Her yesterday's talk with him had
left her with a profound impression of his power, and
that impression had been fresh all the morning.
This painfully written letter, with its stiff, hard
sentences, headed "Save the Union!" and beginning
"Brothers," recalled to her with a shock another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
element of his personality. It was as though his
crudity had dissociated itself from his other qualities
and laid itself, bare and unrelieved, before her eyes.</p>

<p>As she read the letter a second time she felt a
desire to improve upon his sentences; but she thought
this might give him offense; and she thought also,
and rightly, that his stilted sentences, rich with such
epithets, as "tyrant," "bully," "grafter," would
have a stronger effect on his readers than would
more polished and controlled language. So she carried
the letter to the printer as it had left Tom's
hand.</p>

<p>She wrote Tom that Mr. Driscoll was willing her
office should be used for the work of Sunday. Tom's
answer was on a postal card and written in pencil.
She sighed.</p>

<p>The week passed rapidly with Tom, the nights in
canvassing, the days in work. Every time he went
to work, he did so half expecting it would be his
last day on the job. But all went well till Friday
morning. Then the expected happened. As he
came up to the fire-house a hansom cab, which had
turned into the street behind him, stopped and Foley
stepped out.</p>

<p>"Hold on there, Keating!" the walking delegate
called.</p>

<p>Tom paused, three or four paces from the cab.
Foley stepped to his side. "So this's where youse've
sneaked off to work!"</p>

<p>Tom kept his square jaw closed.</p>

<p>"I heard youse were at work. I thought I'd
look youse up to-day. So I followed youse. Now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
are youse goin' to quit this job quiet, or do I have
to get youse fired?"</p>

<p>Tom answered with dangerous restraint. "I
haven't got anything against the contractor. And
I know what you'd do to him to get me off. I'll
go."</p>

<p>"Move then, an' quick!"</p>

<p>"There's one thing I want to say to you first,"
said Tom; and instantly his right fist caught the
walking delegate squarely on the chin. Foley staggered
back against the wheel of the hansom. Without
giving him a second look Tom turned about and
walked toward the car line.</p>

<p>When Foley recovered himself Tom was a score
of paces away. Half a dozen of the workmen were
looking at him in waiting silence. He glared at
Tom's broad back, but made no attempt to follow.</p>

<p>"To-day ain't the only day!" he said to the men,
closing his eyes to ominous slits; and he stepped back
into the cab and drove away.</p>

<p>That evening Tom had an answer to the letter he
had written Mr. Baxter, after having failed once
more to find that gentleman in. It was of but a
single sentence.</p>

<blockquote class="small ps"><p>After giving thorough consideration to your suggestion, I have
decided that it would be neither wise nor in good taste for me to
interfere in the affairs of your union.</p></blockquote>

<p>Tom stared at the letter in amazement. Mr.
Baxter had little to risk, and much to gain. He could
not understand. But, however obscure Mr. Baxter's
motive, the action necessitated by his decision was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
as clear as a noon sun; a vital change had to be made
in the letter to the members of the union. Certain
of Mr. Baxter's consent, Tom had set down the guarantee
to the men as the last paragraph in the letter
and had held the proof awaiting Mr. Baxter's formal
authorization of its use. He now cut out the paragraph
that might have meant a thousand votes, and
mailed the sheet to Ruth.</p>

<p>He talked wherever he could all the next day, and
the next evening. After going home he sat up till
almost one o'clock expecting Pete to come in with
the roster of the members. But Pete did not appear.
Early Sunday morning Tom was over at the
Barrys'. Pete was not yet up, Mrs. Barry told him.
Tom softly opened the door of Pete's narrow room
and stepped in. Pete announced himself asleep by
a mighty trumpeting. Tom shook his shoulders.
He stirred, but did not open his eyes. "Doan wan'
no breakfas'," he said, and slipped back into unconsciousness.
Tom shook him again, without response.
Then he threw the covers back from Pig Iron's feet
and poured a little water on them. Pete sat suddenly
upright; there was a meteoric shower of language;
then he recognized Tom.</p>

<p>"Hello, Tom! What sort of a damned society
call d'you call this?"</p>

<p>"If you only worked as hard as you sleep, Pete,
you could put up a building alone," said Tom, exasperated.
"D'you get the book?"</p>

<p>"Over there." Pete pointed to a package lying
on the floor.</p>

<p>Tom picked it up eagerly, sat down on the edge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
the bed&mdash;Pete's clothes were sprawling over the only
chair&mdash;and hastily opened it. Within the wrapping
paper was the secretary's book.</p>

<p>"How'd you get it, Pete?"</p>

<p>"The amount o' licker I turned into spittoons last
night, Tom, was certainly an immoral waste. If
I'd put it where it belonged, I'd be drunk for life.
Connelly, he'll never come to. Now, s'pose you
chase along, Tom, an' let me finish things up with
my bed."</p>

<p>"What time d'you want the book again?"</p>

<p>"By nine to-night."</p>

<p>"Will you have any trouble putting it back in
the office?"</p>

<p>"Sure not. While I had Connelly's keys I made
myself one to his office. I took a blank and a file
with me last night."</p>

<p>At ten o'clock, the hour agreed upon, Tom was in
Ruth's office. Ruth and a business-looking woman
of middle age, who was introduced as a Mrs. Somebody,
were already there when he came. Five boxes
of envelopes were stacked on a table, which had been
drawn to the center of the room, the letters were on
a smaller table against one wall, and sheets of stamps
were on the top of Ruth's desk.</p>

<p>Tom was appalled when he saw what a quantity
twenty-five hundred envelopes were. "What! We
can't write names on all those to-day!"</p>

<p>"It'll take the two of us about seven hours with
you reading the names to us," Ruth reassured him.
"I had the letters come folded from the printers.
We'll put them in the envelopes and put on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
stamps to-morrow. They'll all be ready for the
mail Monday night."</p>

<p>Until five o'clock, with half an hour off for lunch,
the two women wrote rapidly, Tom, on the opposite
side of the table, reading the names to them alternately
and omitting the names of the adherents of
Foley.</p>

<p>Now that she was with him again Ruth soon forgot
all about Tom's crudity. His purposeful power,
which projected itself through even so commonplace
an occupation as reading off addresses, rapidly remade
its first impression. It dwarfed his crudity to insignificance.</p>

<p>When he left her at her door she gave him her
hand with frank cordiality. "You'll come Thursday
evening then to tell me all about it as you promised.
When I see you then I'm sure it will be to
congratulate you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<div class="drop">

<p class="cap_1">Buck Foley's greatest weakness was the
consciousness of his strength. Two years
before he would have been a much more
formidable opponent, for then he was alert
for every possible danger and would have put forth
his full of strength and wits to overwhelm an aspiring
usurper. Now he was like the ring champion of
several years' standing who has become too self-confident
to train.</p></div>

<p>Foley felt such security that he made light of the
first reports of Tom's campaigning brought him by
his intimates. "He can't touch me," he said confidently.
"After he rubs sole leather on asphalt a
few more weeks, he'll be so tame he'll eat out o' my
hand."</p>

<p>It was not till the meeting at which Tom's ticket
was presented that Foley awoke to the possibility of
danger. He saw that Tom was tremendously in
earnest, that he was working hard, that he was gaining
strength among the men. If Tom were to succeed
in getting out the goody-goody element, or even
a quarter of it&mdash;&mdash;Foley saw the menacing possibility.</p>

<p>Connelly hurried up to him at the close of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
meeting. "Say, Buck, this here looks serious!" he
whispered. "A lot o' the fellows are gettin' scared."</p>

<p>"What's serious?"</p>

<p>"Keating's game."</p>

<p>"I'd forgotten that. I keep forgettin' little
things. Well, s'pose youse get the bunch to drop in
at Mulligan's."</p>

<p>Half an hour later Foley, who knew the value of
coming late, sauntered into the back room of Mulligan's
saloon, which drinking-place was distant two
blocks from Potomac Hall. This back room was
commonly known as "Buck's Office," for here he
met and issued orders to his lieutenants. It was a
square room with a dozen chairs, three tables, several
pictures of prize fighters and several nudes of
the brewers' school of art. Connelly, Jake Henderson,
and six other men sat at the tables, beer glasses
before them, talking with deep seriousness.</p>

<p>Foley paused in the doorway. "Hello, youse
coffin-faces! None o' this for mine!" He started
out.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Buck!" Connelly cried, starting up.</p>

<p>Foley turned back. "Take that crape off your
mugs, then!"</p>

<p>"We were talkin' about Keating," Connelly
explained. "It strikes us he means business."</p>

<p>It was a principle in Foley's theory of government
not to ask help of his lieutenants in important affairs
except when it was necessary; it fed his love of power
to feel them dependent upon his action. But it was
also a principle that they should feel an absolute confidence
in him. He now saw dubiety on every face;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
an hour's work was marked out. He sat down, threw
open his overcoat, put one foot on a table and
tipped back in his chair. "Yes, I s'pose Keating
thinks he does mean business."</p>

<p>With his eyes fixed carelessly on the men he drew
from a vest pocket a tight roll of bills, with 100
showing at either end, and struck a match; and moved
the roll, held cigar-wise between the first and second
fingers of his left hand, and the match toward his
mouth. With a cry Connelly sprang forward and
seized his wrist.</p>

<p>"Now what the hell&mdash;&mdash;" Foley began, exasperatedly.
His eyes fell to his hand, and he grinned.
"Well! Now I wonder where that cigar is." He
went one by one through the pockets of his vest.
"Well, I reckon I'll have to buy another. Jake, ask
one o' the salesladies to fetch in some cabbage."</p>

<p>Jake Henderson stepped to the door and called for
cigars. Mulligan himself responded, bearing three
boxes which he set down before Foley. "Five, ten
and fifteen," he said, pointing in turn at the boxes.</p>

<p>Foley picked up the cheapest box and snuffed at its
contents. "These the worst youse got?"</p>

<p>"Got some two-fers."</p>

<p>"Um! Make youse think youse was mendin' the
asphalt, I s'pose. I guess these's bad enough. Help
youselves, boys." But it was the fifteen-cent box he
started around.</p>

<p>The men took one each, and the box came back to
Foley. "Hain't youse fellows got no vest pockets?"
he demanded, and started the box around again.</p>

<p>When the box had completed its second circuit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
Mulligan took it and the two others and started out.
"Hold on, Barney," said Foley. "What's the matter
with your beer?"</p>

<p>"My beer?"</p>

<p>"Been beggin' the boys to have some more, but
they don't want it."</p>

<p>"My beer's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hi, Barney! Don't youse see he's shootin' hot
air into youse?" cried Jake delightedly. "Chase
in the beer!"</p>

<p>"No, youse don't have to drink nothin' youse
don't like. Bring in some champagne, Barney. I'm
doin' a scientific stunt. I want to see what champagne
does to a roughneck."</p>

<p>"How much?" asked Mulligan.</p>

<p>"Oh, about a barrel." He drew from his trousers
pocket a mixture of crumpled bills, loose silver, and
keys. From this he untangled a twenty-dollar bill
and handed it to Mulligan.</p>

<p>"Fetch back what youse don't want. An' don't
move like your feet was roots, neither."</p>

<p>Two minutes later Mulligan returned with four
quart bottles. Immediately behind him came a girl
in the dress of the Salvation Army. "Won't you
help us in our work?" she said, holding her tin box
out to Foley.</p>

<p>"Take what youse want." He pointed with his
cigar to the change Mulligan had just laid upon the
table.</p>

<p>With hesitation she picked up a quarter. "This
much?" she asked, smiling doubtfully.</p>

<p>"No wonder youse're poor!" He swept all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
change into his palm. "Here!" and he thrust it into
her astonished hands.</p>

<p>After she had stammered out her thanks and
departed, Foley began to fill the glasses from a bottle
Mulligan had opened. Jake, moistening his lips,
put out his hand in mock refusal.</p>

<p>"Only a drop for me, Buck."</p>

<p>Foley filled Jake's glass to the brim. "Well,
there's several. Pick your choice."</p>

<p>He filled the other glasses, then lifted his own with
a "Here's how!" They all raised the fragile goblets
clumsily and emptied them at a gulp. "Now
put about twenty dollars' worth o' grin on your faces,"
Foley requested.</p>

<p>"But what about Keating?" asked Connelly
anxiously, harking back to the first subject. "He's
startin' a mighty hot fight. An' really, Buck, he's a
strong man."</p>

<p>"Yes, I reckon he is." Foley put one hand to his
mouth and yawned mightily behind it. "But he's
sorter like a big friend o' mine who went out to cut
ice in July. His judgment ain't good."</p>

<p>"Of course, he ain't got no chance."</p>

<p>"The same my friend had o' fillin' his ice-house."</p>

<p>"But it strikes me we ought to be gettin' busy,"
Connelly persisted.</p>

<p>"See here, Connelly. Just because I ain't got a
couple o' niggers humpin' to keep the sweat wiped
off me, youse needn't think I'm loafin'," Foley
returned calmly.</p>

<p>The others, who had shared Connelly's anxiety,
were plainly affected by Foley's large manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Youse can just bet Buck'll be there with the goods
when the time comes," Jake declared confidently.</p>

<p>"That's no lie," agreed the others.</p>

<p>"Oh, I ain't doubtin' Buck. Never a once!" said
Connelly. "But what's your plans, Buck?"</p>

<p>Foley gazed mysteriously over their heads, and
slowly blew out a cloud of smoke. "Youse just keep
your two eyes lookin' my way."</p>

<p>Foley knew the value of coming late. He also
knew the value of leaving as soon as your point is
made. His quick eyes now saw that he had restored
the company's confidence; they knew he was prepared
for every event.</p>

<p>"I guess I'll pull out," he said, standing up.
"Champagne ain't never been the same to me since
me an' Morgan went off in his yacht, an' the water
give out, an' we had to wash our shirts in it." He
looked through the door into the bar-room. "Say,
Barney, if these roughnecks want anything more, just
put it down to me." He turned back to the men.
"So-long, boys," he said, with a wave of his hand,
and went out through the bar-room.</p>

<p>"The man that beats Buck Foley's got to beat five
aces," declared Jake admiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes," agreed Connelly. "An' he don't keep a
strangle holt on his money, neither."</p>

<p>Which two sentiments were variously expressed
again and again before the bottoms of the bottles
were reached.</p>

<p>If Foley was slow in getting started, he was not
slow to act now that he was started. During the following
two weeks any contractor that so wished could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
have worked non-union men on his jobs for all the
trouble Foley would have given him. Buck had
more important affairs than the union's affairs.</p>

<p>Foley's method of electioneering was even more
simple than Tom's. He saw the foreman on every
important job in the city. To such as were his
friends he said:</p>

<p>"Any o' that Keating nonsense bein' talked on
this job?" If there was not: "Well, it's up to
youse to see that things stay that way." If there
was: "Shut it up. If any o' the men talk too loud,
fire 'em. If youse ain't got that authority, find somethin'
wrong with their work an' get 'em fired. It's
your business to see that not a man on your job votes
again' me!"</p>

<p>To such few as he did not count among his friends
he said:</p>

<p>"Youse know enough to know I'm goin' to win.
Youse know what's the wise thing for youse to do,
all right. I like my friends, an' I don't like the men
that fight me. I ain't likely to go much out o' my
way to help Keating an' his push. I think that's
enough, ain't it?"</p>

<p>It was&mdash;especially since it was said with a cold
look straight into the other's eyes. An hour's speech
could not have been more effective.</p>

<p>Foley made it his practice to see as many of the
doubtful workmen as possible during their lunch
hour. He had neither hope nor desire that they
should come out and vote for him. His wish was
merely that they should not come out and vote for
Tom. To them his speech was mainly obvious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
threats. And he called upon the rank and file of his
followers to help him in this detail of his campaign.
"Just tell 'em youse think they won't enjoy the
meetin' very much," was his instruction, given with
a grim smile; and this opinion, with effective elaboration,
his followers faithfully delivered.</p>

<p>When Foley dropped into his office on the Tuesday
night before election he found Jake, Connelly
and the other members of his cabinet anxiously
awaiting him. Connelly thrust a copy of Tom's letter
into his hands. "Now wha' d'you think o' that?"
he demanded. "Blamed nigh every man in the
union got one to-night."</p>

<p>As Foley read the blood crept into his face.
"'Bully,' 'blood-suckin' grafter', 'trade union
pirate', 'come out and make him walk the plank',"
Jake quoted appreciatively, watching Foley's face.</p>

<p>By the time he reached the end Foley had regained
his self-control. "Well, that's a purty nice piece o'
writin', ain't it, now?" he said, looking at the sheet
admiringly. "Didn't know Keating was buttin' into
literchure. Encouragin', ain't it, to see authors
springin' up in every walk o' life. This here'll get
Keating the votes o' all the lit'ry members, sure."</p>

<p>"It'll get him too many!" growled Connelly
anxiously.</p>

<p>"A-a-h, go count yourself, Connelly!" Foley
looked at the secretary with a pity that was akin to
disgust. "Youse give me an unpleasant feelin' in
my abdomen!"</p>

<p>He pushed the letter carelessly across to Connelly.
"O' course it'll bring the boys out," he said, in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
previous pleasant voice. "But the trouble with Keating
is, he believes in the restriction o' output. He
believes a man oughtn't to cast more'n one vote a
day."</p>

<p>But Foley, for all his careless jocularity, was aware
of the seriousness of Tom's last move, and till long
after midnight the cabinet was in session&mdash;to the
great profit of Barney Mulligan's cash register.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<div class="drop">

<p class="cap_1">Tom set out for Potomac Hall Wednesday
evening with the emotions of a gambler
who had placed his fortune on a single
color; his all was risked on the event of
that night. However, he had a bracing confidence
running through his agitation; he felt that he controlled
the arrow of fortune. The man to man canvass;
the feminine influence made operative by Mrs.
Barry; the letters with which Ruth had helped him,&mdash;these,
he was certain, had drawn the arrow's head
to the spot where rested his stake and the union's.</p></div>

<p>Tom reached the hall at six-thirty. The polls did
not open till seven, but already thirty or forty of
Foley's men stood in knots in front of the building.</p>

<p>"Hello, boys! Now don't he think he's It!"
said one admiringly.</p>

<p>"Poor Buck! This's the last o' him!" groaned
another.</p>

<p>There was a burst of derisive laughter, and each
of the party tossed a bit of language in his way; but
Tom made no answer and passed them unflinchingly.
At the doorway he was stopped by the policeman who
was regularly stationed at Potomac Hall on meeting
nights.</p>

<p>"Goin' to have a fist sociable to-night?" the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
policeman asked, anxiously watching the men in the
street.</p>

<p>"Can't say, Murphy. Ask Foley. He'll be floor
manager, if there is one."</p>

<p>As he went through the hallway toward the stairs,
Tom paused to glance through a side door into the
big bar-room, which, with a café, occupied the whole
of the first floor. A couple of score of Foley men
stood at the bar and sat about the tables. It certainly
did look as if there might be festivities.</p>

<p>Tom mounted the broad stairway and knocked at
the door of the union's hall. Hogan, the sergeant-at-arms,
a Foley man, gingerly admitted him. The
hall in which he found himself was a big rectangular
room, perhaps fifty by one hundred feet. The walls
had once been maroon in color, and had a broad
moulding of plaster that had been white and gilt; the
ceiling had likewise once been maroon, and was
decorated with plaster scroll-work and crudely
painted clusters of fruits and flowers&mdash;scroll-work
and paintings lacking their one-time freshness. From
the center of the ceiling hung a great ball of paper
roses; at the front of the room was a grand piano in
a faded green cover. The sign advertising the hall,
nailed on the building's front, had as its last clause:
"Also available for weddings, receptions, and balls."</p>

<p>Tom's glance swept the room. All was in readiness
for the election. The floor was cleared of its
folding chairs, they being now stacked at the rear of
the room; down the hall's middle ran a row of tables,
set end to end, with chairs on either side; Bill Jackson,
one of his supporters, was at Hogan's elbow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
ready to hand out the ballots as the men were
admitted; the five tellers&mdash;Barry, Pete, Jake and two
other Foley men&mdash;were smoking at the front of the
room, Jake lolling on the piano, and the other four
on the platform where the officers sat at the regular
meetings.</p>

<p>Tom joined Pete and Barry, and the three drew
to one side to await the opening of the door. "Anything
new?" Tom asked.</p>

<p>"Nothin'," answered Pete. "But say, Tom, that
letter was certainly hot stuff! I've heard some o' the
boys talkin' about it. They think it's great. It's
bringin' a lot o' them out."</p>

<p>"That's good."</p>

<p>"An' we're goin' to win, sure."</p>

<p>Tom nodded. "If Foley don't work some of his
tricks."</p>

<p>"Oh, we'll look out for that," said Pete confidently.</p>

<p>Promptly at seven o'clock Hogan unlocked the
door. The men began to mount the stairway. As
each man came to the door Hogan examined his
membership card, and, if it showed the holder to
be in good standing, admitted him. Jackson then
handed him a ballot, on which the names of all the
candidates were printed in a vertical row, and he
walked to one of the tables and made crosses before
the names of the men for whom he desired to vote.</p>

<p>Five minutes after the door had been opened there
were thirty or forty men in the room, an equal number
of each party, Foley among them. Jake, who
was chief teller, rose at the center table on the plat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>form
to discharge the formality of offering the ballot-box
for inspection. He unlocked the box, which
was about twelve inches square, and performing a
slow arc presented the open side to the eyes of the
tellers and the waiting members. The box was
empty.</p>

<p>"All right?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Sure," said the men carelessly. The tellers
nodded.</p>

<p>Foley began the telling of a yarn, and was straightway
the center of the group of voters. In the meantime
Jake locked the box and started to carry it to
its appointed place on a table at one end of the platform,
to reach which he had to pass through the
narrow space between the wall and the chair-backs
of the other tellers. As he brushed through this
alley, Tom, whose eyes had not left him, saw the
ballot-box turn so that its slot was toward the wall,
and glimpsed a quick motion of Jake's hand from a
pocket toward the slot&mdash;a motion wholly of the
wrist. He sprang after the chief teller and seized
his hand.</p>

<p>"You don't work that game!" he cried.</p>

<p>Foley's story snapped off. His hearers pivoted
to face the disturbance.</p>

<p>Jake turned about. "What game?"</p>

<p>"Open your hand!" Tom demanded.</p>

<p>Jake elevated his big fist, then opened it. It held
nothing. He laughed derisively, and set the box
down in its place. A jeering shout rose from Foley's
crowd.</p>

<p>For an instant Tom was taken aback. Then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
stepped quickly to the table and gave the box a
light shake. He triumphantly raised it on high and
shook it violently. From it there came an unmistakable
rattle.</p>

<p>"This's how Foley'd win!" he cried to the crowd.</p>

<p>Jake, his derision suddenly changed to fury, would
have struck Tom in another instant, for all his wits
were in his fists; but the incisive voice of Foley
sounded out: "A clever trick, Keating."</p>

<p>"How's that?" asked several men.</p>

<p>"A trick to cast suspicion on us," Foley answered
quietly. "Keating put 'em in there himself."</p>

<p>Tom stared at him, then turned sharply upon
Jake. "Give me the key. I'll show who those ballots
are for."</p>

<p>Jake, not understanding, but taking his cue from
Foley, handed over the key. Tom unlocked the box,
and took out a handful of tightly-folded ballots. He
opened several of them and held them up to the
crowd. The crosses were before the Foley candidates.</p>

<p>"Of course I put 'em in!" Tom said sarcastically,
looking squarely at Foley.</p>

<p>"O' course youse did," Foley returned calmly.
"To cast suspicion on us. It's a clever trick, but it's
what I call dirty politics."</p>

<p>Tom made no reply. His eyes had caught a slight
bulge in the pocket of Jake's coat from which he had
before seen Jake's hand emerge ballot-laden. He
lunged suddenly toward the chief teller, and thrust a
hand into the pocket. There was a struggle of an
instant; the crowd saw Tom's hand come out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
pocket filled with packets of paper; then Tom broke
loose. It all happened so quickly that the crowd had
no time to move. The tellers rose just in time to lay
hands upon Jake, who was hurling himself upon Tom
in animal fury.</p>

<p>Tom held the ballots out toward Foley. They
were bound in packets half an inch thick by narrow
bands of papers which were obviously to be snapped
as the packet was thrust into the slot of the box. "I
suppose you'll say now, Buck Foley, that I put these
in Henderson's pocket!"</p>

<p>For once Foley was at a loss. Part of the crowd
cursed and hissed him. His own men looked at him
expectantly, but the trickery was too apparent for his
wits to be of avail. He glared straight ahead, rolling
his cigar from side to side of his mouth.</p>

<p>Tom tossed the ballots into the open box.
"Enough votes there already to elect Foley. Now I
demand another teller instead of that man." He
jerked his head contemptuously toward Jake.</p>

<p>Foley's composure was with him again. "Anything
to please youse, Tom. I guess nobody's got a
kick again' Connelly. Connelly, youse take Jake's
place."</p>

<p>As the exchange was being made the Foleyites
regarded their leader dubiously; not out of disapproval
of his trickery, but because his attempted
jugglery had failed. Foley had recourse again to his
confidence-compelling glance&mdash;eyes narrowed and
full of mystery. "It's only seven-thirty, boys!" he
said in an impressive whisper, and turned and went
out. Jake glowered at Tom and followed him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom transferred the ballots from the box to his
pockets, locked the box, turned over the key to the
tellers, and was resuming his seat when he saw a
man of disordered dress at the edge of the platform,
who had been anxiously awaiting the end of this
episode, beckoning him. Tom quickly stepped to his
side. "What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"Hell's broke loose downstairs, Tom," said the
man. "Come down."</p>

<p>"Look out for any more tricks," Tom called to
Pete, and hurried out. The stairway was held from
top to bottom by a line of Foley men. Foley supporters
were marching up, trading rough jests with
these guardsmen; but not a single man of his was on
the stairs. He saw one of his men start up, and
receive a shove in the chest that sent him upon his
back. A laugh rose from the line. Tom's fists
knotted and his eyes filled with fire. The head
guardsman tried to seize him, and got one of the fists
in the face.</p>

<p>"Look out, you&mdash;&mdash;!" He swore mightily at the
line, and plunged downward past the guards, who
were held back by a momentary awe. The man below
rose to his feet, hotly charged, and was sent staggering
again. Tom, descending, caught the assailant by
the collar, and with a powerful jerk sent him sprawling
upon the floor. He turned fiercely upon the line.
But before he could even speak, half of it charged
down upon him, overbore him and swept him through
the open door into the street. Then they melted away
from him and returned to their posts.</p>

<p>Tom, bruised and dazed, would have followed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
men back through the doorway, but his eyes came
upon a new scene. On his either hand in the street,
which was weakly illumined by windows and corner
lights, several scuffles were going on, six or seven in
each; groups of Foley men were blocking the way
of his supporters, and blows and high words were
passing; farther away he could dimly see his men
standing about in hesitant knots&mdash;having not the reckless
courage to attempt passage through such a rowdy
sea.</p>

<p>The policeman was trying to quell one of the scuffles
with his club. Tom saw it twisted from his
hand. Murphy drew his revolver. The club sent
it spinning. He turned and walked quickly out of
the street.</p>

<p>All this Tom saw in two glances. The man beside
him swore. "Send for the police, Tom. Nothing
else'll save us." His voice barely rose above the cries
and oaths.</p>

<p>"It won't do, Smith. We'd never hear the last
of it."</p>

<p>And yet Tom realized, with instant quickness, the
hopelessness of the situation. Against Foley's organized
ruffianism, holding hall and street, his unorganized
supporters, standing on the outskirts, could do
nothing. There was but one thing to be done&mdash;to
get to his men, organize them in some way, wait till
their number had grown, and then march in a body
to the ballot-box.</p>

<p>Ten seconds after his discharge into the street Tom
was springing away on this errand, when out of the
tail of his eye he saw Foley come to the door and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
glance about. He wheeled and strode up to the walking
delegate.</p>

<p>"Is this your only way of winning an election?"
he cried hotly.</p>

<p>"Well! well! They're mixin' it up a bit, ain't
they," Foley drawled, looking over Tom's head.
"That's too bad!"</p>

<p>"Don't try any of your stage business on me!
Stop this fighting!"</p>

<p>"What could I do?" Foley asked deprecatingly.
"If I tried, I'd only get my nut cracked." And he
turned back into the hall.</p>

<p>"Come on!" Tom cried to Smith; and together
they plunged eastward, in which direction were the
largest number of Tom's friends. Before they had
gone a dozen paces they were engulfed in the fray.
Several of his men swept in from the outskirts to
his support; more Foley men rushed into the conflict;
the fight that had before been waged in skirmishes
was now a general engagement. For a space
that seemed an hour to Tom, but that in reality was
no more than its quarter, it was struggle at the top
of his strength. He warded off blows. He stung
under fists. He struck out at dim faces. He swayed
fiercely in grappling arms. He sent men down. He
went down again and again himself. And oaths
were gasped and shouted, and deep-lunged cries battered
riotously against the street's high walls....
And so it was all around him&mdash;a writhing, striking,
kicking, swearing whirlpool of men, over whose
fierce turbulence fell the dusky light of bar-room and
tenement windows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p>After a time, when his breath was coming in gasps,
and his strength was well-nigh gone, he saw the
vindictive face of Jake Henderson, with the bar-room's
light across it, draw nearer and nearer
through the struggling mob. If Jake should reach
him, spent as he was&mdash;&mdash;He saw his limp, outstretched
body as in a vision.</p>

<p>But Jake's vengeance did not then fall. Tom
heard a cry go up and run through the crowd:
"Police! Police!" In an instant the whirlpool
half calmed. The cry brought to their feet the two
men who had last borne him down. Tom scrambled
up, saw the mob untangle itself into individuals, and
saw, turning the corner, a squad of policemen, clubs
drawn, Murphy marching at the captain's side.</p>

<p>The captain drew his squad up beside the doorway
of the hall, and himself mounted the two steps. "If
there's any more o' this rough house, I'll run in every
one o' you!" he shouted, shaking his club at the
men.</p>

<p>The Foleyites laughed, and defiance buzzed
among them, but they knew the better part of valor.
It was a Foley principle to observe the law when the
law is observing you.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the captain's threat was made
even more potent for order by the appearance of the
reserves from another precinct; and in a little while
still another squad leaped from clanging patrol
wagons, making in all fifty policemen that had
answered Murphy's call. Twenty of these were
posted in the stairway, and the rest were placed on
guard in the street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p>A new order came from the bar-room, and Foley's
men withdrew to beyond the limits of police influence
and intercepted the men coming to vote, using
blandishment and threats, and leading some into the
bar-room to be further convinced.</p>

<p>Tom, who stood outside watching the restoration
of order, now started back to the hall. On the way
he glanced through the side door into the bar-room.
It was heavy with smoke, and at the bar was a
crowd, with Foley as its center. "I don't know
what youse think about Keating callin' in the police,"
he was saying, "but youse can bet I know what
Buck Foley thinks! A man that'll turn the police
on his own union!" And then as a fresh group of
men were led into the room: "Step right up to the
counter, boys, an' have your measure taken for a
drink. I've bought out the place, an' am givin' it
away. Me an' Carnegie's tryin' to die poor."</p>

<p>Tom mounted to the hall with a secret satisfaction
in the protection of the broad-chested bluecoats that
now held the stairway. A fusillade of remarks from
the men marking their ballots greeted his entrance,
but he passed up to the platform without making
answers.</p>

<p>Pete's mouth fell agape at sight of him. "Hello!
You look like you been ticklin' a grizzly under the
chin!"</p>

<p>Tom noted the relishing grins of the Foley tellers.
"The trouble downstairs is all over. I'll tell you all
about it after awhile," he said shortly; and sat down
just behind Pete to watch the voting.</p>

<p>Up to this time the balloting had been light. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
now the hall began to fill, and the voting proceeded
rapidly&mdash;and orderly, too, thanks to the policemen
on stairway and in street. Tom, his clothes "lookin'
like he tried to take 'em off without unbuttonin'," as
a Foley teller whispered, his battered hat down over
his eyes, sat tilted against the wall scanning every
man that filed past the box. As man after man had
his membership card stamped "voted," and dropped
in his ballot, Tom's excitement rose, for he recognized
the majority of the men that marched by as of
his following.</p>

<p>At nine o'clock Pete leaned far back in his chair.
"Lookin' great, ain't it?" he whispered.</p>

<p>"If it only keeps up like this." That it might
not was Tom's great fear now.</p>

<p>"Oh, it will, don't you worry."</p>

<p>The line of voters that marched by, and by, bore
out Pete's prediction, as Tom's counting eyes saw.
He had the wild exultation and throbbing weakness
of the man who is on the verge of success. But the
possibility of failure, the cause of his weakness,
became less and less as time ticked on and the votes
dropped into the ballot box. His enthusiasm grew.
Dozens of plans flashed through his head. But his
eyes never left that string of men who were deciding
his fate and that of the union.</p>

<p>At half past ten Tom was certain of his election.
Pete leaned back and gripped his hand. "It's a
cinch, Tom. It's a shame to take the money," he
whispered.</p>

<p>Tom acquiesced in Pete's conviction with a jerk of
his head, and watched the passing line, now grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
thin and slow, drop in their ballots, his certainty
growing doubly sure.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes later Foley entered the hall,
whispered a moment with Hogan at the door, a
moment with Connelly, and then went out again.
Tom thought he saw anxiety showing through
Foley's ease of manner, and to him it was an advance
taste of triumph.</p>

<p>Tom wished eleven o'clock had come and the door
was locked. The minutes passed with such exhausting
slowness. A straggling voter dropped in his
ballot&mdash;and another straggler&mdash;and another. Tom
looked at his watch. Two minutes had passed since
Foley's visit. Another straggling voter. And then
four men appeared in a body at the hall door, all
apparently the worse for Foley's hospitality. Tom
saw the foremost present his card. Hogan glanced
at it, and handed it back. "You can't vote that
card; it's expired," Tom heard him say.</p>

<p>"What's that?" demanded the man, threateningly.</p>

<p>"The card's expired, I said! You can't vote it!
Get out!"</p>

<p>"I can't vote it, hey!" There was an oath, a
blow&mdash;a surprisingly light blow to produce such an
effect, so it seemed to Tom&mdash;and Hogan staggered
back and went to the floor. There was a scuffle; the
tables on which lay the ballots toppled over, and the
ballots went fluttering. By this time Tom reached
the door, policemen had rushed in and settled the
scuffle, and the four men were being led from the
room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p>Hogan was unhurt, but Jackson was so dazed from
a blow that Tom had to put another man in his
place.</p>

<p>The minutes moved toward eleven with slow, ticking
steps. Two stragglers ... at long intervals.
At a few minutes before eleven the exhausting monotony
was enlivened by the entrance of eight men,
singing boisterously and jostling each other in alcoholic
jollity. They marked their ballots and staggered
in a group to the ballot-box. Two tried to
deposit their ballots at once.</p>

<p>"Leave me alone, will youse!" cried one, with an
oath, and struck at the other.</p>

<p>The ballot-box slipped across to the edge of the
table. Connelly, who sat just behind the box, made
no move for its safety. "Hey, stop that!" cried
Pete and sprang across to seize it. But he was too
late. The one blow struck, the eight were all instantly
delivering blows, and pushing and swearing.
The box was knocked forward upon the floor, and
the eight sprawled pell-mell upon it.</p>

<p>Tom and the tellers sprang from behind the
tables upon the scuffling heap, and several policemen
rushed in from the hallway. The men, once dragged
apart, subsided and gave no trouble. They were
allowed to drop their ballots in the box, now back in
its place on the table, and were then led out in quietness
by the officers.</p>

<p>Pete turned about, struck with a sudden fear. "I
wonder if that was a trick?" he whispered.</p>

<p>Tom's face was pale. The same fear had come
to him. "I wonder!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p>In another five minutes the door was locked and
the tellers were counting the ballots. Among the
first hundred there were perhaps a score that bore
no mark except a cross before Foley's name. Pete
looked again at Tom. With both fear had been
replaced by certainty.</p>

<p>"The box's been stuffed!" Pete whispered.</p>

<p>Tom nodded.</p>

<p>His only hope now was that not enough false ballots
had been got into the box to carry the election.
But as the count proceeded, this hope left him. And
the end was equal to his worst fears. The count
stood: for walking delegate, Foley 976, Keating
763; for president, Keating 763, Foley's man 595;
all the other Foley candidates won by a slight margin.
The apparent inconsistencies of this count Tom
readily understood even in the first wild minutes.
Foley's running ahead of his ticket was to be explained
on the ground that the brief time permitted
of a cross being put before his name alone on the
false ballots; his own election to the unimportant
presidency, and the failure of his other candidates,
was evidently caused by several of his followers
splitting their tickets and voting for the minor Foley
candidates.</p>

<p>As the count had proceeded Tom had exploded
more than once, and Pete had made lurid use of his
gift. When Connelly read off the final results Tom
exploded again.</p>

<p>"It's an infernal steal!" he shouted.</p>

<p>"Even if it is, what can we do?" returned Connelly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span></p>

<p>Words ran high. But Tom quickly saw the uselessness
of protests and accusations at this time.
His great desire now was to take his heat and disappointment
out into the street; and so he gave evasive
answers to Pete and Barry, who wanted to talk it
over, and made his way out of the hall alone.</p>

<p>Cheers and laughter were ascending from the bar-room.
As he was half-way down the stairs the door
of the saloon opened, and Foley came out and started
up, followed by a number of men. Among them
Tom saw several of the drunken group that had
upset the ballot-box; and he also saw that they probably
had not been more sober in years.</p>

<p>"Why, hello, Tom!" Foley cried out on sight of
him. "D'youse hear the election returns?"</p>

<p>Tom looked hard at Foley's face with its leering
geniality, and he was almost overmastered by a desire
to hurl himself upon Foley and annihilate him.
"You infernal thief!" he burst out.</p>

<p>Foley sidled toward him across the broad step.
"I'll pass that by. I can afford to, for youse're
about wiped out. I guess youse've had enough."</p>

<p>"Enough?" cried Tom. "I've just begun!"</p>

<p>With that he brushed by Foley and passed through
the door out into the street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE DAY AFTER</p>
<div class="drop">

class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">The distance to Tom's home was half a
hundred blocks, but he chose to walk.
Anger, disappointment, and underlying
these the hopeless sense of being barred
from his trade, all demanded the sympathy of physical
exertion&mdash;and, too, there was the inevitable
meeting with his wife. Walking would give him an
hour before that.</p></div>

<p>It was after one when he opened the hall door
and stepped into his flat. Through the dining-room
he could see the gas in the sitting-room was turned
down to a point, and could see Maggie lying on the
couch, a flowered comforter drawn over her. He
guessed she had stayed up to wait for his report.
He listened. In the night's dead stillness he could
faintly hear her breath come deep and regular. Seizing
at the chance of postponing the scene, he cautiously
closed the hall door, and, sitting down on a chair
beside it, removed his shoes. He crossed on tiptoe
toward their bedroom, but its door betrayed
him by a creak. He turned quickly about. There
was Maggie, propped up on one arm, the comforter
thrown back.</p>

<p>She looked at him for a space without speaking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Through all his other feelings Tom had a sense that
he made anything but a brave figure, standing in his
stocking feet, his shoes in one hand, hat and overcoat
on.</p>

<p>"Well?" she demanded at length.</p>

<p>Tom returned her fixed gaze, and made no reply
to her all-inclusive query.</p>

<p>Her hands gripped her covering. She gave a
gasp. Then she threw back the comforter and
slipped to her feet.</p>

<p>"I understand!" she said. "Everything! I knew
it! O-o-h!" There were more resentment and recrimination
packed into that prolonged "oh" than
she could have put into an hour's upbraiding.</p>

<p>Tom kept himself in hand. He knew the futility
of explanation, but he explained. "I won, fairly.
But Foley robbed me. He stuffed the ballot-box."</p>

<p>"It makes no difference how you lost! You lost!
That's what I've got to face. You know I didn't
want you to go into this. I knew you couldn't win.
I knew Foley was full of tricks. But you went in.
You lost wages. You threw away money&mdash;<i>our</i>
money! And what have you got to show for it all?"</p>

<p>Tom let her words pass in silence. On his long
walk he had made up his mind to bear her fury
quietly.</p>

<p>"Oh, you!" she cried through clenched teeth,
stamping a bare foot on the floor. "You do what
you please, and I suffer for it. You wouldn't take
my advice. And now you're out of a job and can't
get one in your trade. How are we to live? Tell
me that, Tom Keating? How are we to live?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>Only the word he had passed with himself enabled
Tom to hold himself in after this outburst. "I'll
find work."</p>

<p>"Find work! A hod-carrier! Oh, my God!"</p>

<p>She turned and flung herself at full length upon
the couch, and lay there sobbing, her hands passionately
gripping the comforter.</p>

<p>Tom silently watched the workings of her passion
for a moment. He realized the measure of right
on her side, and his sense of justice made his spirit
unbend. "If we have to live close, it'll only be for a
time," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" she moaned.</p>

<p>He grimly turned and went into the bedroom.
After a while he came out again. She had drawn
the comforter over her, but her irregular breathing
told him she was still awake.</p>

<p>"Aren't you coming to bed?" he asked.</p>

<p>She made no answer, and he went back. For half
an hour he tossed about. Then he came into the sitting-room
again. Her breath was coming quietly
and regularly. He sat down and gazed at her handsome
face for a long, long time, with misty, wondering
thoughts. Then he rose with a deep-drawn sigh,
took part of the covering from the bed, and spread
it over her sleeping figure.</p>

<p>He tossed about long before he fell into a restless
sleep. It was early when he awoke. He
looked into the sitting-room. Maggie was still
sleeping. He quickly dressed himself in his best
suit (the one he had had on the night before was
beyond further wearing), noting with surprise that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
his face bore few marks of conflict, and stole quietly
out.</p>

<p>Tom's disappointment and anger were too fresh
to allow him to put his mind upon plans for the
future. All day he wandered aimlessly about, talking
over the events of the previous night with such
of his friends as chance put in his path. Late in the
afternoon he met Pete and Barry, who had been looking
for work since morning. They sat down in a
saloon and talked about the election till dinner time.
It was decided that Tom should protest the election
and appeal to the union&mdash;a move they all agreed
had little promise. Tom found a soothing gratification
in Pete's verbal handling of the affair; there was
an ease, a broadness, a completeness, to Pete's profanity
that left nothing to be desired; so that Tom
was prompted to remark, with a half smile: "If
there was a professorship of your kind of English
over at Columbia University, Pete, you'd never have
to put on overalls again."</p>

<p>Tom had breakfasted in a restaurant, and lunched
in a restaurant, and after Pete and Barry left he had
dinner in one. It was a cheap and meager meal;
with his uncertain future he felt it wise to begin to
count every cent. Afterwards he walked about the
streets till eight, bringing up at Ruth's boarding-house.
The colored maid who answered his ring
brought back the message: "Miss Arnold says will
you please come up."</p>

<p>He mounted the stairway behind the maid. Ruth
was standing at the head of the stairs awaiting
him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>She wore a loose white gown, held in at the waist
by a red girdle, and there was a knot of red in her
heavy dark hair. Tom felt himself go warm at
sight of her, and there began a throbbing that beat
even in his ears.</p>

<p>"You don't mind my receiving you in my room,
do you?" she said, opening her door, after she had
greeted him.</p>

<p>"Why, no," said Tom, slightly puzzled. His
acquaintance with the proprieties was so slight that
he did not know she was then breaking one.</p>

<p>She closed the door. "I'm glad to see you. I
know what happened last night; we heard at the
office." She held out her hand again. The grip
was warm and full of sympathy.</p>

<p>The hand sent a thrill through Tom. In his
fresh disappointment it was just this intelligent sympathy
that he was hungry for. For a moment he
was unable to speak or move.</p>

<p>She gently withdrew her hand. "But we heard
only the bare fact. I want you to tell me the whole
story."</p>

<p>Tom laid his hat and overcoat upon the couch,
which had a dull green cover, glancing, as he did
so, about the room. There were a few prints of
good pictures on the walls; a small case of books; a
writing desk; and in one corner a large screen whose
dominant color was a dull green. The thing that
struck him most was the absence of the knick-knackery
with which his home was decorated. Tom was
not accustomed to give attention to his surroundings,
but the room pleased him; and yet it was only an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
ordinary boarding-house room, plus the good taste
of a tasteful woman.</p>

<p>Tom took one of the two easy chairs in the room,
and once again went over the happenings of the previous
night. She interrupted again and again with
indignant exclamations.</p>

<p>"Why, you didn't lose at all!" she cried, when
he had finished the episode of the eight drunken men.</p>

<p>"You won, and it was stolen from you! Your Mr.
Foley is a&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;" Whichever way she turned for
an adequate word she ran against a restriction barring
its use by femininity. "A robber!" she ended.</p>

<p>"But aren't you going to protest the election?"</p>

<p>"I shall&mdash;certainly. But there's mighty little
chance of the result being changed. Foley'll see to
that."</p>

<p>He tried to look brave, but Ruth guessed the bitterness
within. She yearned to have him talk over
things with her; her sympathy for him now that she
beheld him dispirited after a daring fight was even
warmer than when she had seen him pulsing with
defiant vigor. "Won't you tell me what you are
going to do? If you don't mind."</p>

<p>"I'd tell if I knew. But I hardly have my bearings
yet."</p>

<p>"Are you sure you can't work at your trade?"</p>

<p>"Not unless I kiss Foley's shoes."</p>

<p>She did not like to ask him if he were going to
give in, but the question was in her face, and he
saw it.</p>

<p>"I'm not that bad licked yet."</p>

<p>"There's Mr. Driscoll's offer," she suggested.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes. I've thought of that. I don't know what
move I'll make next. I don't just see now how I'm
going to keep at the fight, but I'm not ready to give
it up. If I took Mr. Driscoll's job, I'd have to drop
the fight, for I'd practically have to drop out of the
union. If the protest fails&mdash;well, we'll see."</p>

<p>Ruth looked at him thoughtfully, and she thrilled
with a personal pride in him. He had been beaten;
the days just ahead looked black for him; but his
spirit, though exhausted, was unbroken. As a result
of her experience she was beginning to regard business
as being largely a compromise between self-respect
and profit. In Tom's place she guessed what
Mr. Baxter would do, and she knew what Mr. Driscoll
would do; and the thing they would do was not
the thing that Tom was doing. And she wondered
what would be the course of Mr. Berman.</p>

<p>At the moment of parting she said to him, in her
frank, impulsive way: "I think you are the bravest
man I have ever known." He could only stumble
away from her awkwardly, for to this his startled
brain had no proper answer. His courage began to
bubble back into him; and the warmth aroused by her
words grew and grew&mdash;till he drew near his home,
and then a chill began to settle about him.</p>

<p>Maggie was reading the installment of a serial
story in an evening paper when he came in. She
glanced up, then quickly looked back at her paper
without speaking.</p>

<p>He started into the bedroom in silence, but paused
hesitant in the doorway and looked at her. "What
are you reading, Maggie?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Scarlet Stain."</p>

<p>He held his eyes upon her a moment longer, and
then with a sigh went into the bedroom and lit the
gas. The instant he was gone from the doorway
Maggie took her eyes from the story and listened
irresolutely. All day her brain had burnt with angry
thoughts, and all day she had been waiting the chance
to speak. But her obstinate pride now strove to keep
her tongue silent.</p>

<p>"Tom!" she called out, at length.</p>

<p>He appeared in the doorway. "Yes."</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>He was silent for a space. "I don't just know
yet."</p>

<p>"I know," she said in a voice she tried to keep cold
and steady. "There's only one thing for you to do.
That's to get on the square with Foley."</p>

<p>Their eyes met. Hers were cold, hard, rebellious.</p>

<p>"I'll think it over," he said quietly; and went back
into the bedroom.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idct.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">The next morning after breakfast Tom sat
down to take account of his situation.
But his wife's sullen presence, as she
cleared away the dishes, suffocated his
thoughts. He went out and walked south a few
blocks to a little park that had formerly served the
neighborhood as a burying-ground. A raw wind was
chattering among the bare twigs of the sycamore
trees; the earth was a rigid shell from the night's
frost, and its little squares and oblongs of grass were
a brownish-gray; the sky was overcast with gray
clouds. The little park, this dull March day, was
hardly more cheerful than the death it had erewhile
housed, but Tom sat down in its midst with a sense
of grateful relief.</p></div>

<p>His mind had already passed upon Maggie's demand
of the previous evening. But would it avail
to continue the fight against Foley? He had slept
well, and the sleep had strengthened his spirit and
cleared his brain; and Ruth's recurring words, "I
think you are the bravest man I have ever known,"
were to him a determining inspiration. He went
over the situation detail by detail, and slowly a new
plan took shape.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<p>Foley had beaten him by a trick. In six months
there would be another election. He would run
again, and this next time, profiting by his dear experience
of Wednesday night, he would see that guard
was set against every chance for unfair play. During
the six months he would hammer at Foley's every
weak spot, and emphasize to the union the discredit
of Foley's discreditable acts.</p>

<p>He would follow up his strike agitation. He had
already put Foley into opposition to a demand for
more money. If he could induce the union to make
the demand in the face of Foley's opposition it would
be a telling victory over the walking delegate. Perhaps,
even, he might head the management of the
strike&mdash;if it came to a strike. And if the strike were
won, it would be the complete undoing of Foley. As
for Maggie, she would oppose the plan, of course, but
once he had succeeded she would approve what he
had done. In the meantime he would have to work
at some poorly paid labor, and appease her as best
he could.</p>

<p>At dinner that night little was said, till Maggie
asked with a choking effort: "Did you see Foley
to-day?"</p>

<p>"No," said Tom. He ate a mouthful, then laid
down knife and fork, and looked firmly into her face.
"I didn't try to see him. And I might as well tell
you, Maggie, that I'm not going to see him."</p>

<p>"You'll not see him?" she asked in a dry voice.
"You'll not see him?"</p>

<p>"Most likely it would not do any good if I did see
him. You mark what I say, Maggie," he went on,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
hopefully. "Foley thinks I'm down, and you do, too,
but in a few months things'll be better than they ever
were. We may see some hard times&mdash;but in the
end!"</p>

<p>"You were just that certain last week. But how'll
we live?"</p>

<p>"I'll find some sort of a temporary job."</p>

<p>She looked at him tensely; then she rose abruptly
and carried her indignant grief into the kitchen. She
had decided that he must be borne with. But would
he never, never come to his senses!</p>

<p>After he had finished his dinner, which had been
ready earlier than usual, Tom hurried to the Barrys',
and found the family just leaving the table. He
rapidly sketched his new plan.</p>

<p>"You're runnin' again' Foley again in six months
is all right, but where's the use our tryin' to get more
money?" grumbled Pete. "Suppose we fight hard
an' win the strike. What then? We get nothin'
out of it. Foley won't let us work."</p>

<p>"Oh, talk like a man, Pete!" requested Mrs.
Barry. "You know you don't think that way."</p>

<p>"If we win the strike, with Foley against it, it'll
be the end of him," said Tom, in answer to Pete.</p>

<p>"But suppose things turn out with Foley in control
o' the strike?" questioned Barry.</p>

<p>"That won't happen. But if it would, he'd run it
all on the square. And he'd manage it well, too. You
know what he has done. Well, he'd do the same
again if he was forced into a fight.</p>

<p>"It won't be hard to work the men up to make the
demand for an increase," Tom went on. "All the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
men who voted for me are in favor of it, and a lot
more, too. All we've got to do is to stir them up a
bit, and get word to them to come out on a certain
night. Foley'll hardly dare put up a fight against us
in the open."</p>

<p>"Whoever runs the strike, we certainly ought to
have more money," said Mrs. Barry decidedly.</p>

<p>"And the bosses can afford to give us more,"
declared Tom. "They've never made more than
they have the last two years."</p>

<p>"Sure, they could divide a lot o' the money we've
made with us, an' still not have to button up their
own clothes," averred Mrs. Barry.</p>

<p>"Oh, I dunno," said Pete. "They're hard up,
just the same as us. What's a hundred thousand
when you've got to spend money on yachts, champagne
an' Newport, an' other necessities o' life? The
last time I was at the Baxters', Mrs. Baxter was settin'
at the kitchen table figgerin' how she could make
over the new dress she had last summer an' wonderin'
how she'd ever pay the gas bill."</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry grunted.</p>

<p>"I got a picture o' her!"</p>

<p>Tom brought the talk back to bear directly upon
his scheme, and soon after left, accompanied by Pete,
to begin immediately his new campaign.</p>

<p>As soon as they had gone Mrs. Barry turned eagerly
to her husband. "If we get that ten per cent.
raise, Henry won't have to go to work when he's
fourteen like we expected."</p>

<p>"Yes. I was thinkin' o' that."</p>

<p>"An' we could keep him in school mebbe till he's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
eighteen. Then he could get a place in some office
or business. By that time Annie'll be old enough to
go to normal college. She can go through there and
learn to be a teacher."</p>

<p>"An' mebbe I can get you some good clothes, like
I've always wanted to."</p>

<p>"Oh, you! D'you think you can buy everything
with seventy dollars!" She leaned over with glowing
eyes and kissed him.</p>

<p>Rapid work was required by the new campaign,
for Tom had settled upon the first meeting in April
as the time when he would have the demand for more
wages put to a vote. The new campaign, however,
would be much easier than the one that had just
come to so disastrous an ending. As he had said, the
men were already eager to make the demand for more
money; his work was to unite this sentiment into a
movement, and to urge upon the men that they be
out to vote on the first Wednesday in April.</p>

<p>Tom's first step was to enlist the assistance of the
nine other men who had helped him in his fight
against Foley. He found that the vengeance of the
walking delegate had been swift; seven had abruptly
lost their jobs. When he had explained his new plan,
eight of the nine were with him. The spirit of the
ninth was gone.</p>

<p>"I've had enough," he said bitterly. "If I
hadn't mixed in with you, I'd be all right now."
Upon this man Tom promptly turned his back. He
was an excellent ally to be without.</p>

<p>Tom, with Pete, Barry, and his eight other helpers,
began regularly to put in each evening in calling upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
the members of the union. Every man they saw was
asked to talk to others. And so the word spread and
spread.</p>

<p>And to Foley it came among the first. Jake Henderson
heard it whispered about the St. Etienne Hotel
Saturday, and when the day's work was done he hurried
straight to Foley's home in order to be certain
of catching Buck when he came in to dinner. He had
to wait half an hour, but that time was not unpleasantly
spent, inasmuch as Mrs. Foley set forth a bottle
of beer.</p>

<p>When Foley caught the tenor of Jake's story his
face darkened and he let out an oath. But immediately
thereafter he caught hold of his excitement.
While Jake talked Foley's mind worked rapidly. He
did not want a strike for three sufficient reasons. First
of all, that the move was being fathered by Tom was
enough to make him its opponent. Secondly, he had
absolutely nothing to gain from a strike; his power
was great, and even a successful strike could not add
to it. And last, he would lose financially by it; his
arrangement with Baxter and one or two other contractors
would come to an end, and in the management
of a general strike so many persons were
involved that he would have no chance to levy tribute.</p>

<p>Before Jake had finished his rather long-winded
account Foley cut him short. "Yes. I'm glad youse
come in. I was goin' to send for youse to-night about
this very thing."</p>

<p>"What! Youse knew all about it already?"</p>

<p>Foley looked surprise at him. "D'youse think I
do nothin' but sleep?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nobody can't tell youse anything," said Jake
admiringly. "Youse're right up to the minute."</p>

<p>"Some folks find me a little ahead." He pulled
at his cigar. "I got a little work for youse an' your
bunch."</p>

<p>Jake sprang up excitedly. "Not Keating?"</p>

<p>"If youse could guess that well at the races youse'd
always pick the winner. This business's got to stop,
an' I guess that's the easiest way to stop it." And,
Foley might have added, the only way.</p>

<p>"He ought to've had it long ago," said Jake, with
conviction.</p>

<p>"He'll enjoy it all the more for havin' to wait for
it." He stood up, and Jake, accepting his dismissal,
took his hat. "Youse have a few o' the boys around
to-night, an' I'll show up about ten. Four or five
ought to be enough&mdash;say Arkansas, Smoky, Kaffir
Bill, and Hickey."</p>

<p>Foley saw Connelly and two or three other members
of his cabinet during the evening, and gave
orders that the word was to go forth among his followers
that he was against Keating's agitation; he
knew the inside facts of present conditions, and knew
there was no chance of winning a strike. At ten
o'clock he sauntered into the rear room of Mulligan's
saloon. Five men were playing poker. With
the exception of one they were a group to make an
honest man fall to his knees and quickly confess his
sins. Such a guileless face had the one that the honest
man would have been content with him as confessor.
In past days the five had worked a little, each in his
own part of the world, and not liking work had pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>cured
their living in more congenial ways; and on
landing in New York, in the course of their wanderings,
they had been gathered in by Foley as suited to
his purpose.</p>

<p>"Hello, Buck!" they called out at sight of Foley.</p>

<p>"Hello, gents," he answered. He locked the door
with a private key, and kicked a chair up to the table.</p>

<p>"Say, Buck, I got a thirst like a barrel o' lime,"
remarked he of the guileless face, commonly known
as Arkansas Number Two. "D'you know anything
good for it?"</p>

<p>"The amount o' money I spend in a year on other
men's drinks'd support a church," Foley answered.
But he ordered a quart of whisky and glasses.
"Now let's get to business," he said, when they had
been placed on the table. "I guess youse've got an
idea in your nuts as to what's doin'?"</p>

<p>"Jake put us next," grinned Kaffir Bill. "Keating."</p>

<p>"Yes. He's over-exertin' his throat. He's likely
to spoil his voice, if we don't sorter step in an' stop
him."</p>

<p>"But Jake didn't tell us how much youse wanted
him to have," said Kaffir Bill. "Stiff?"</p>

<p>"Not much. Don't youse remember when youse
made an undertaker's job out o' Fleischmann? An'
how near youse come to takin' the trip to Sing Sing?
We don't want any more risks o' that sort. Leave
your guns at home." Foley gulped down the raw
whisky. "A couple months' vacation'd be about
right for Keating. It'd give him a chance to get
acquainted with his wife."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>He drew out a cigar and fitted it to one corner of
his mouth. "He's left handed, youse know. An'
anyhow he works mostly with his mouth."</p>

<p>"An' he's purty chesty," said Jake, following up
Foley's cue with a grin.</p>

<p>"That's the idea," said Foley. "A wing, an' say
two or three slats. Or a leg."</p>

<p>The five understood and pledged the faithful discharge
of their trust in a round of drinks.</p>

<p>"But what's in it for us?" asked Arkansas Number
Two.</p>

<p>"It's an easy job. Youse get him in a fight, he
goes down; youse do the business with your feet.
Say ten apiece. That's plenty."</p>

<p>"Is that all it's worth to you?" Arkansas asked
cunningly.</p>

<p>"Make it twenty-five, Buck," petitioned Kaffir
Bill. "We need the coin. What's seventy-five more
to youse?"</p>

<p>The other four joined in the request.</p>

<p>"Well, if I don't I s'pose every son-of-a-gun o'
youse'll strike," said Foley, assuming the air of a
defeated employer. "All right&mdash;for this once. But
this ain't to be the regular union rate."</p>

<p>"You're all to the good, Buck!" the five shouted.</p>

<p>Foley rose and started out. At the door he paused.
"Youse can't ask me for the coin any too soon," he
said meaningly.</p>

<p>The five held divergent opinions upon many subjects,
but upon one point they were as one mind&mdash;esteem
for the bottle. So when Buck's quart of
whisky was exhausted they unanimously decided to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
remove themselves to Potomac Hall, in whose bar-room
there usually could be found someone that,
after a dark glance or two, was delighted to set out
the drinks.</p>

<p>They quickly found a benefactor in the person
of Johnson, also a devotee of the bottle. They
were disposing of the third round of drinks when
Pete, who had been attending a meeting of the Membership
Committee of the union, passed through the
bar-room on his way out. Jake saw him, and, three
parts drunk, could not resist the opportunity for
advance satisfaction. "Hold on, Pig Iron," he
called after him.</p>

<p>Pete stopped, and Jake walked leeringly up to
him. "This here&mdash;&mdash;" the best Jake could do in
the way of profanity, "Keating is goin' to get what's
comin' to him!" Jake ended with a few more selections
from his repertoire of swear-words.</p>

<p>Pete retorted in kind, imperatively informing Jake
that he knew where he could go, and walked away.
Pete recognized the full meaning of Jake's words;
and a half hour later he was knocking on Tom's door.
He found a tall, raw-boned man sitting in one of
Tom's chairs. Maggie had gone to bed.</p>

<p>"Shake hands with Mr. Petersen, Pete," said
Tom sleepily. "He's just come into the union."</p>

<p>"Glad to know you," said Pete, and offered a hand
to the Swede, who took it without a word. He turned
immediately about on Tom. "I guess you're in
for your thumps, Tom." And he told about his meeting
with the five members of the entertainment committee.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>"I expected 'em before the election. Well, I'll be
ready for 'em," Tom said grimly.</p>

<p>A light had begun to glow in Petersen's heavy eyes
as Pete talked. He now spoke for the first time since
Pete had come in. "Vot day do?" he asked.</p>

<p>Pete explained in pantomine, thrusting rapid fists
close to various parts of Petersen's face. "About
five men on you at once."</p>

<p>Petersen grunted.</p>

<p>When Pete left, the Swede remained in his chair
with anxiety showing through his natural stolidity.
Tom gave a helpless glance at him, and followed
Pete out into the hall.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, Pete, help me out!" Tom said
in a whisper. "He's the fellow I helped get into the
union. I told you about him, you know. He came
around to-night to tell me he's got a job. When I
came in at half past ten he'd been here half an hour
already. It's eleven-thirty now. And he ain't said
ten words. I want to go to bed, but confound him,
he don't know how to leave!"</p>

<p>Pete opened the door. "Say, Petersen, ain't you
goin' my way? Come on, we'll go together."</p>

<p>Petersen rose with obvious relief. He shook hands
with Tom in awkward silence, and together he and
Pete went down the stairs.</p>

<p>Monday morning Tom bought the first revolver
he had ever possessed. If he had had any doubt as
to the correctness of Pete's news, that doubt would
not have been long with him. During the morning,
as he went about looking for a job, he twice caught
a glimpse of three members of the entertainment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
committee watching him from the distance; and he
knew they were waiting a safe chance to close in upon
him. The revolver in his inner vest pocket pressed
a welcome assurance against his ribs.</p>

<p>That night when he came down from dinner to
carry his new plan from ear to ear, he found Petersen,
hands in his overcoat pockets, standing patiently
without the doorway of the tenement.</p>

<p>"Hello, Petersen," he said in surprise.</p>

<p>"Hello," said Petersen.</p>

<p>Tom wanted no repetition of his experience of
Saturday night. "Got a lot of work to do to-night,"
he said hurriedly. "So-long."</p>

<p>He started away. The Swede, with no further
words, fell into step beside him. For several blocks
they walked in silence, then Tom came to a pause before
a tenement in which lived a member of the
union.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Petersen," he said.</p>

<p>"Goo'-by," said Petersen.</p>

<p>They shook hands.</p>

<p>When Tom came into the street ten minutes later
there was Petersen standing just where he had left
him. Again the Swede fell into step. Tom, though
embarrassed and irritated by the man's silent, persistent
company, held back his words.</p>

<p>At the second stop Tom said shortly: "I'll be
here a long while. You needn't wait."</p>

<p>But when he came down from the call, which he
had purposely extended, Petersen was waiting beside
the steps. This was too much for Tom. "Where
are you going?" he demanded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Long you," the Swede answered slowly.</p>

<p>"I don't know's I need you," Tom returned
shortly, and started away.</p>

<p>For half a dozen paces there was no sound but his
own heel-clicks. Then he heard the heel-clicks of the
Swede. He turned about in exasperation. "See
here! What's your idea in following me around
like this?"</p>

<p>Petersen shifted his feet uncomfortably. "De
man, last night, he say&mdash;&mdash;" He finished by placing
his bony fists successively on either side of his jaw.
"I tank maybe I be 'long, I be some good."</p>

<p>A light broke in on Tom. And he thought of the
photograph on Petersen's leprous wall. He shoved
out his hand. "Put it there, Petersen!" he said.</p>

<p>And all that evening Tom's silent companion
marched through the streets beside him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">MR. BAXTER HAS A FEW CONFERENCES</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idcc.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="C" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">Captains of war have it as a common
practice to secure information, in such
secret ways as they can, about their
opponents' plans and movements, and to
develop their own plans to match these; and this
practice has come into usage among captains of industry.
The same afternoon that Jake brought news
of Tom's scheme to Foley, a man of furtive glance
whom a member of the union would have recognized
as Johnson requested the youth in the outer office of
Baxter &amp; Co. to carry his name to the head of the
firm.</p></div>

<p>"Wha' d'youse want to see him 'bout?" demanded
the uniform.</p>

<p>"A job."</p>

<p>"No good. He don't hire nobody but the foremen."</p>

<p>"It's a foreman's job I'm after," returned Johnson,
glancing about.</p>

<p>The debate continued, but in the end Johnson's
name went in to Mr. Baxter, and Johnson himself
soon followed it. When he came out Mr. Baxter's
information was as complete as Buck Foley's.</p>

<p>That evening Johnson's news came into the conversation
of Mr. Baxter and his wife. After dinner
she drew him into the library&mdash;a real library, booked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
to the ceiling on three sides, an open wood fire on the
other&mdash;to tell him of a talk she had had that day
with chance-met Ruth. With an aunt's privilege she
had asked about the state of affairs between her and
Mr. Berman.</p>

<p>"There's no telling what she's going to do," Mrs.
Baxter went on, with a gentle sigh. "I do hope she'll
marry him! People are still talking about her strange
behavior in leaving us to go to work. How I did
try to persuade her not to do it! I knew it would
involve us in a scandal. And the idea of her offering
to go to work in your office!"</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter continued to look abstractedly into the
grate, as he had looked ever since she had begun her
half-reminiscent strain. Now that she was ended,
she could but note that his mind was elsewhere.</p>

<p>"James!"</p>

<p>"Yes." He turned to her with a start.</p>

<p>"Why, you have not spoken a word to me. Is
there something on your mind?"</p>

<p>He studied the flames for a moment. "I learned
this afternoon that the Iron Workers' Union will
probably demand a ten per cent. increase in wages."</p>

<p>"What! And that means a strike?"</p>

<p>"It doubtless does, unless we grant their demand."</p>

<p>"But can you afford to?"</p>

<p>"We could without actually running at a loss."</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter was on the board of patronesses of
one or two workingwomen's clubs and was a contributor
to several fashionable charities, so considered
herself genuinely thoughtful of the interests of wage-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>earners.
"If you won't lose anything, I suppose
you might as well increase their salaries. Most of
them can use a little more money. They're respectable
people who appreciate everything we do for them.
And you can make it up by charging higher prices."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter sat silent for a space looking at his
wife, quizzically, admiringly. He was inclined to
scoff in his heart at his wife's philanthropic hobbies,
but he indulged her in them as he did in all her efforts
to attain fashionable standing. He had said, lover
fashion, in their courtship days, that she should never
have an ungratified wish, and after a score of years
he still held warmly to this promise. He still admired
her; and little wonder, for sitting with her
feet stretched toward the open fire, her blonde head
gracefully in one hand, her brown eyes fixed waitingly
on him, looking at least eight less than her forty-three
years, she was absolutely beautiful.</p>

<p>"Elizabeth," he said at length, "do you know
how much we spent last year?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"About ninety-three thousand dollars."</p>

<p>"So much as that? But really, it isn't such a big
sum. A mere nothing to what some of our friends
spend."</p>

<p>"This year, with our Newport house, it'll be a
good thirty thousand more; one hundred and twenty-five
thousand, anyway. Now I can't make the owners
pay the raise, as you seem to think." He smiled
slightly at her business naïveté. "The estimates on
the work I'll do this year were all made on the
present scale, and I can't raise the estimates. If the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
ten per cent. increase is granted, it'll have to come out
of our income. Our income will be cut down for this
year to at least seventy-five thousand. If things go
bad, to fifty thousand."</p>

<p>Mrs. Baxter rose excitedly to her feet. "Why,
that's absurd!"</p>

<p>"We'd have to give up the Newport house," he
went on, "put the yacht out of commission and lessen
expenses here."</p>

<p>She looked at her husband in consternation. After
several years of effort Mrs. Baxter was just getting
into the outer edge of the upper crust of New York
society. At her husband's words she saw all that she
had striven for, and which of late had seemed near
of attainment, withdraw into the shadowy recesses
of an uncertain future.</p>

<p>"But we can't cut down!" she cried desperately.
"We simply can't! We couldn't entertain here in
the manner we have planned. And we'd have to go
to Atlantic City this summer, or some other such
place!&mdash;and who goes to Atlantic City? Why, we'd
lose everything we've gained! We can never give
the raise, James. It's simply out of the question!"</p>

<p>"And we won't," said Mr. Baxter, gently tapping
a forefinger upon the beautifully carved arm of his
chair.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, suppose we do spend a hundred and
twenty-five thousand, why the working people get
everything back in wages," she added ingeniously.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter realized the economic fallacy of this
last statement; but he refrained from exposing her
sophistry since her conscience found satisfaction in it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>Monday morning, in discharge of his duty as
president of the Iron Employers' Association, Mr.
Baxter got Murphy, Bobbs, Isaacs, and Driscoll,
the other four members of the Executive Committee,
on the telephone. At eleven o'clock the five men
were sitting around Mr. Baxter's cherry table.
Bobbs, Murphy, and Isaacs already had knowledge
of Tom's plans; Mr. Baxter was not the only one
having unionists on his payroll who performed services
other than handling beams and hammering
rivets. Mr. Driscoll alone was surprised when Mr.
Baxter stated the object of calling the committee
thus hastily together.</p>

<p>"Why, I thought we'd been assured the old schedule
would be continued!" he said.</p>

<p>"So Mr. Foley gave us to understand," answered
Mr. Baxter. "But it's another man, a man named
Keating, that's stirring this up."</p>

<p>"Keating!" Mr. Driscoll's lips pouted hugely,
and his round eyes snapped. For a man to whom he
had taken a genuine liking to be stirring up a fight
against his interest was in the nature of a personal
affront to him.</p>

<p>"I think I know him," said Mr. Murphy. "He
ain't such a much!"</p>

<p>"That shows you don't know him!" said Mr.
Driscoll sharply. "Well, if there is a strike, we'll
at least have the satisfaction of fighting with an
honest man."</p>

<p>"That satisfaction, of course," admitted Mr.
Baxter, in his soft, rounded voice. "But what shall
be our plan? It is certainly the part of wisdom for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
us to decide upon our attitude, and our course, in
advance."</p>

<p>"Fight 'em!" said Mr. Driscoll.</p>

<p>"What is the opinion of you other gentlemen?"</p>

<p>"They don't deserve an increase, so I'm against
it," said Mr. Bobbs. Had he spoken his thought
his answer would have been: "It'll half ruin me if
we give the increase. Fact is, I've gone in pretty
heavy in some real estate lately. If my profits are
cut down, I can't meet my payments."</p>

<p>"Same as Driscoll," said Mr. Murphy, a blowzed,
hairy man, a Tammany member of the Board of
Aldermen. He swore at the union. "Why, they're
already gettin' twice what they're worth!"</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter raised his eyebrows the least trifle at
Mr. Murphy's profanity. "Mr. Isaacs."</p>

<p>"I don't see how we can pay more. And yet if
we're tied up by a strike for two or three months
we'll lose more than the increase of wages would
come to."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter answered the doubtful Mr. Isaacs in
his smooth, even tones. "You seem to forget, Mr.
Isaacs, that if we grant this without a fight, there'll
be another demand next spring, and another the year
after. We're compelled to make a stand now if we
would keep wages within reasonable bounds."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose so," agreed Mr. Isaacs.</p>

<p>"Besides, if there is a strike it is not at all likely
that it will last any time," Mr. Baxter continued.
"We should break the strike easily, with a division
in the union, as of course you see there is,&mdash;this Mr.
Keating on one side, Mr. Foley on the other. I've<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
met Mr. Keating. I dare say he's honest enough,
as Mr. Driscoll says. But he is inexperienced, and I
am sure we can easily outgeneral him."</p>

<p>"Beat 'em easy, an' needn't spit on our hands to
do it neither," said Mr. Murphy. He started to
swing one foot upon the cherry table, but catching
Mr. Baxter's eye he checked the leg in mid-career.</p>

<p>Straightway the five plunged into an excited discussion
of the chance of beating the strike, of plans
for fighting it, and of preparation that should be
made in anticipation of it.</p>

<p>When they had gone Mr. Baxter sat down to his
desk and began writing a note. He had listened to
the talk of the four, to him mere chatter, with outward
courtesy and inward chafing, not caring to mention
to them the plan upon which he had already
decided. His first impulse had been to fight the
union, and fight it hard. He hated trade unionism
for its arrogation of powers that he regarded as the
natural right of the employer; it was his right, as the
owner of a great business, and as the possessor of a
superior intelligence, to run his affairs as he saw
fit&mdash;to employ men on his own terms, work them
such hours and under such conditions as he should
decide&mdash;terms, hours, and conditions, of course, to
be as good as he could afford. But his business training,
his wholly natural instinct for gain, and later
his large family expenses, had fixed upon him the
profitable habit of seeking the line of least resistance.
And so, succeeding this first hot impulse, was a
desire that the strike be avoided&mdash;if that were
possible.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>His first thought had been of Foley. But the
fewer his meetings with the walking delegate of the
iron workers, the more pleased was he. Then came
the second thought that it was better to deal directly
with the threatening cause&mdash;and so the letter he now
wrote was to Tom Keating.</p>

<p>The letter was delivered Tuesday morning before
Tom left home. He read it in wonderment, for to
him any letter was an event:</p>

<blockquote class="small ps"><p>"Will you please call at my office as soon as you can find it
convenient. I have something to say that I think will interest
you."</p></blockquote>

<p>Guessing wildly as to what this something might
be, Tom presented himself at ten o'clock in the outer
office of Baxter &amp; Co. The uniform respectfully
told him that Mr. Baxter would not be in before
twelve. At twelve Tom was back. Yes, Mr. Baxter
was in, said the uniform, and hurried away with
Tom's name. Again there was a wait before the boy
came back, and again a wait in a sheeny chair before
Mr. Baxter looked up.</p>

<p>"Oh, Mr. Keating," he said. "I see you got my
letter."</p>

<p>"Yes. This morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter did not lose a second. "What I
wanted to see you about is this: I understand that
some time ago you were inquiring here for a position.
It happens that I have a place just now that I'm
desirous of filling with an absolutely trustworthy
man. Mr. Driscoll spoke very highly to me of you,
so I've sent for you."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>

<p>This offer came to Tom as a surprise. His uppermost
guess as to the reason for his being summoned
had been that Mr. Baxter, repenting of his late non-participation,
now wished to join in the fight against
Foley. Under other circumstances Tom would have
accepted the position, said nothing, and held the
job as long as he could. But the fact that the offer
was coming to him freely and in good faith prompted
him to say: "You must know, Mr. Baxter, that
if you give me a job Foley'll make trouble for
you."</p>

<p>"I have no fear of Mr. Foley's interference,"
Mr. Baxter answered him quietly.</p>

<p>"You haven't!" Tom leaned forward in sudden
admiration. "You're the first boss I've struck yet
that's not afraid of Foley! He's got 'em all scared
stiff. If you'd come out against him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Tom would have said more but Mr. Baxter's cold
reserve, not a change of feature, chilled his enthusiasm.
He drew up in his chair. "What's the
job?"</p>

<p>"Foreman. The salary is forty a week."</p>

<p>Tom's heart beat exultantly&mdash;and he had a momentary
triumph over Maggie. "I'll take it," he
said.</p>

<p>"Can you begin at once?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Very well. Then I'll want you to leave to-morrow."</p>

<p>Tom started. "Leave?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Didn't I mention that the job is in
Chicago?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Baxter watched Tom closely out of his steely
gray eyes. He saw the flush die out of Tom's face,
saw Tom's clasped hands suddenly tighten&mdash;and
knew his answer before he spoke.</p>

<p>"I can't do it," he said with an effort. "I can't
leave New York."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter studied Tom's face an instant longer....
But it was too honest.</p>

<p>He turned toward his desk with a gentle abruptness.
"I am very sorry, Mr. Keating. Good-day."</p>

<p>With Mr. Baxter there was small space between
actions. He had already decided upon his course in
case this plan should fail. Tom was scarcely out of
his office before he was writing a note to Buck Foley.</p>

<p>Foley sauntered in the next morning, hands in
overcoat pockets, a cigar in one corner of his mouth.
"What's this I hear about a strike?" Mr. Baxter
asked, as soon as the walking delegate was seated.</p>

<p>"Don't youse waste none o' the thinks in your
brain-box on no strike," returned Foley. He had
early discovered Mr. Baxter's dislike of uncouth
expressions.</p>

<p>"But there's a great deal of serious talk."</p>

<p>"There's always wind comin' out o' men's
mouths."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter showed not a trace of the irritation he
felt.</p>

<p>"Is there going to be a strike?"</p>

<p>"Not if I know myself. And I think I do." He
blew out a great cloud of smoke.</p>

<p>"But one of your men&mdash;a Mr. Keating&mdash;is stirring
one up."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>"He thinks he is," Foley corrected. "But he's
got another think comin'. He's a fellow youse ought
to know, Baxter. Nice an' cultivated; God-fearin'
an' otherwise harmless."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter's face tightened. "I know, Mr.
Foley, that this situation is much more serious than
you pretend," he said sharply.</p>

<p>Foley tilted back in his chair. "If youse seen a
lion comin' at youse with a yard or so of open mouth
youse'd think things was gettin' a little serious. But
if youse knew the lion'd never make its last jump,
youse wouldn't go into the occupation o' throwin'
fits, now would youse?"</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"Nothin'. Only there'll be no last jump for Keating."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"How? That's my business." He stood up, relit
his cigar, striking the match on the sole of his shoe.
"Results is what youse's after. The how belongs to
me."</p>

<p>At the door he paused, half closed one eye, and
slowly blew forth the smoke of his cigar. "Now
don't get brain-fag," he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap_1">It was about half past twelve when Tom
left Mr. Baxter's office. As he came purposeless
into the street it occurred to him
that he was but a few blocks from the
office of Mr. Driscoll, and in the same instant his
chance meeting with Ruth three weeks before as she
came out to lunch flashed across his memory. He
turned his steps in the direction of Mr. Driscoll's
office, and on gaining the block it was in walked
slowly back and forth on the opposite side of the
street, eagerly watching the revolving door of the
great building. At length she appeared. Tom
started quickly toward her. Another quarter revolution
of the door and a man was discharged at her
side. The man was Mr. Berman; and they walked
off together, he turning upon her glances whose
meaning Tom's quickened instinct divined at once.</p></div>

<p>The sight of these two together, Mr. Berman's
eyes upon her with an unmistakable look, struck
him through with jagged pain. He was as a man
whose sealed vision an oculist's knife has just released.
Amid startled anguish his eyes suddenly
opened to things he, in his blindness, had never
guessed. He saw what she had come to mean to
him. This was so great that, at first, it well-nigh
obscured all else. She filled him,&mdash;her sympathy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
her intelligence, her high womanliness. And she,
she that filled him, was ... only a great pain.</p>

<p>And then (he had mechanically followed them,
and now stood watching the door within which they
had disappeared&mdash;the door through which he had
gone with her three weeks before) he saw, his pain
writhing within him the while, the double hopelessness
of his love: she was educated, cultured&mdash;she
could care nothing for a mere workman; and even if
she could care, he was bound.</p>

<p>And then (he was now moving slowly through the
Broadway crowd, scarcely conscious of it) he saw
how poor he was in his loveless married life. Since
his first liking for Maggie had run its so brief course,
he had lapsed by such slow degrees to his present
relations with her that he had been hardly more
conscious of his life's lacking than if he had been
living with an unsympathetic sister. But now that a
real love had discovered itself to him, with the suddenness
of lightning that rips open the night, he saw,
almost gaspingly, how glorious life with love could
be; and, by contrast, he saw how sordid and commonplace
his own life was; and he saw this life without
love stretching away its flat monotony, year after
year.</p>

<p>And there were things he did not see, for he had
not been made aware by the unwritten laws prevailing
in a more self-conscious social stratum. And
one of these things was, he did not see that perhaps
in his social ignorance he had done Ruth some great
injury.</p>

<p>That night Maggie kept his dinner warm on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
back of the kitchen range, to no purpose; and that
night Petersen waited vainly on the tenement steps.
It was after twelve when Tom came into the flat,
his face drawn, his heart chilled. He had seen his
course vaguely almost from the first moment of his
vision's release; he had seen it clearer and more
clear as hour after hour of walking had passed; and
he felt himself strong enough to hold to that course.</p>

<p>The next morning at breakfast he was gentler
with Maggie than he had been in many a day; so that
once, when she had gone into the kitchen to refill her
coffee cup, she looked in at him for a moment in a
kind of resentful surprise. Not being accustomed to
peering inward upon the workings of his soul, Tom
himself understood this slight change in his attitude
no better than did his wife. He did not realize that
the coming of the knowledge of love, and the coming
of sorrow, were together beginning to soften and
refine his nature.</p>

<p>The work Tom had marked out for himself permitted
him little time to brood over his new unhappiness.
After breakfast he set out once more upon
his twofold purpose: to find a job, if one could be
found; to talk strike to as many members of the
union as he could see. In seeking work he was
limited to such occupations as had not yet been unionized.
He walked along the docks, thinking to find
something to do as a longshoreman, but the work
was heavy and irregular, the hours long, the pay
small; and he left the river front without asking for
employment. He looked at the men in the tunnel of
the underground railway; but he could not bring him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>self
to ask employment among the low-waged Italians
he saw there. He did go into three big stores
and make blind requests for anything, but at none
was there work for him.</p>

<p>As he went about Tom visited the jobs near which
he passed, on which members of his union were at
work. One of these was a small residence hotel
just west of Fifth Avenue, whose walls were up, but
which was as yet unfinished on the inside. He
climbed to the top in search of members employed on
the iron stairways and the elevator shafts, but did
not find a man. He reached the bottom of the stairway
just in time to see three men enter the doorway.
One of the three he recognized as Jake Henderson,
and he knew the entertainment committee had him
cornered. He grimly changed his revolver from his
vest pocket to his left coat pocket, and filling his
right coat pocket from a heap of sand beside him,
quietly awaited their coming.</p>

<p>The three paused a moment inside the door, evidently
to accustom their eyes to the half darkness,
for all the windows were boarded up. At length
they sighted him, standing before the servants' staircase
in the further corner. They came cautiously
across the great room, as yet unpartitioned, Jake
slightly in the lead. At ten paces away they came to
a halt.</p>

<p>"I guess we got youse good an' proper at last,"
said Jake gloatingly. "It won't do youse no good
to yell. We'll give youse all the more if youse do.
An' we can give it to youse, anyhow, before the men
can get down."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom did not answer. He had no mind to cry
for help. He stood alertly watching them, his hands
in his coat pockets.</p>

<p>Jake laid off his hat and coat&mdash;there was leisure,
and it enlarged his pleasure to take his time&mdash;and
moved forward in advance of his two companions.</p>

<p>"Good-by," he said leering. He was on the point
of lunging at his victim, when Tom's right hand
came out and a fistful of sand went stinging full into
his face. He gave a cry, but before he could so
much as make a move to brush away the sand Tom's
fist caught him on the ear. He dropped limply.</p>

<p>The two men sprang forward, to be met in the
face by Tom's revolver.</p>

<p>"If you fellows want button-holes put into you,
just move another step!" he said.</p>

<p>They took another step, several of them&mdash;but
backward steps. Tom kept them covered for a
minute, then moved toward the light, walking backward,
his eyes never leaving them. On gaining the
door he slipped the revolver into his vest pocket and
stepped quickly into the blinding street.</p>

<p>When Tom, entering the union hall that evening,
passed Jake at his place at the door, the latter scowled
fiercely, but the presence of several of Tom's friends,
who had been acquainted with the afternoon's encounter,
pacified his fists.</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with your eyes, Jake?"
asked Pig Iron Pete sympathetically.</p>

<p>Jake consigned Pete to the usual place, and whispered
in Tom's ear: "Youse just wait! I'll git youse
yet!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>That night Tom sat his first time in the president's
chair. His situation was painfully grotesque,&mdash;instead
of being the result of the chances of election,
it might well have been an ironic jest of Foley: there
was Connelly, two tables away, at his right; Brown,
the vice-president, at the table next him; Snyder, the
corresponding secretary, at his left; Jake Henderson,
sergeant-at-arms, at the door;&mdash;every man of
them an intimate friend of Foley. And it was
not long before Tom felt the farce-tragedy of his
position. Shortly after he rapped the meeting to
order a man in the rear of the hall became persistently
obstreperous. After two censured outbreaks
he rose unsteadily amid the discussion upon a motion.
"I objec'," he said.</p>

<p>"What's your objection?" Tom asked, repressing
his wrath.</p>

<p>The man swore. "Ain't it 'nough I objec'!"</p>

<p>"If the member is out of order again he'll have
to leave the hall." Tom guessed this to be a scheme
of Foley to annoy him.</p>

<p>"Put me out, you&mdash;&mdash;" And the man offered
some remarks upon Tom's character.</p>

<p>Tom pounded the table with his gavel. "Sergeant-at-arms,
put that man out!"</p>

<p>Jake, who stood at the door whispering to a man,
did not even turn about.</p>

<p>"Sergeant-at-arms!"</p>

<p>Jake went on with his conversation.</p>

<p>"Sergeant-at-arms!" thundered Tom, springing
to his feet.</p>

<p>Jake looked slowly around.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>"Put that man out!" Tom ordered.</p>

<p>"Can't youse see I'm busy?" said Jake; and
turned his broad back.</p>

<p>Several of Tom's friends sprang up, but all in
the room waited to see what he would do. For a
moment he stood motionless, a statue of controlled
fury, and for that moment there was stillness in the
hall. Then he tossed the gavel upon the table and
strode down the center aisle. He seized the offending
member, who was in an end seat, one hand on his
collar and one on his wrist. The man struck out,
but a fierce turn of his wrist brought from him a submissive
cry of pain. Tom pushed him, swearing,
toward the door. No one offered interference, and
his ejection was easy, for he was small and half
drunken.</p>

<p>Tom strode back to his table, brought the gavel
down with a blow that broke its handle and looked
about with blazing eyes. Again the union waited
his action in suspense. His chest heaved; he swallowed
mightily. Then he asked steadily: "Are
you ready for the question?"</p>

<p>This is but one sample of the many annoyances
Tom suffered during the meeting, and of the annoyances
he was to suffer for many meetings to come.
A man less obstinately strong would have yielded his
resignation within an hour&mdash;to force which was half
the purpose of the harassment; and a man more
violent would have broken into a fury of words,
which, answering the other half of the purpose,
would have been to Foley's crew what the tirade of a
beggar is to teasing schoolboys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>When "new business" was reached Tom yielded
the chair to Brown, the vice-president, and rose to
make the protest on which he had determined. He
had no great hope of winning the union to the action
he desired; but it had become a part of his nature
never to give up and to try every chance.</p>

<p>The union knew what was coming. There were
cheers and hisses, but Tom stood waiting minute
after minute till both had died away. "Mr. Chairman,
I move we set aside last week's election of walking
delegate," he began, and went on to make his
charges against Foley. Cries of "Good boy, Tom!"
"Right there!" came from his friends, and various
and variously decorated synonyms for liar came from
Foley's crowd; but Tom, raising his voice to a shout,
spoke without pause through the cries of friends and
foes.</p>

<p>When he ended half the crowd was on foot demanding
the right to the floor. Brown dutifully
recognized Foley.</p>

<p>Foley did not speak from where he stood in the
front row, but sauntered angularly, hands in trousers
pockets, to the platform and mounted it. With
a couple of kicks he sent a chair from its place against
the wall to the platform's edge, leisurely swung his
right foot upon the chair's seat, rested his right
elbow upon his knee, and with cigar in the left corner
of his mouth, and his side to his audience, he began to
speak.</p>

<p>"When I was a kid about as big as a rivet I used
to play marbles for keeps," he drawled, looking at
the side wall. "When I won, I didn't make no kick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
When I lost, a deaf man could 'a' heard me a mile.
I said the other kid didn't play fair, an' I went cryin'
around to make him give 'em up."</p>

<p>He paused to puff at his cigar. "Our honorable
president, it seems he's still a kid. Me an' him
played a little game o' marbles last week. He lost.
An' now he's been givin' youse the earache. It's
the same old holler. He says I didn't play fair. He
says I tried to stuff the box at the start. But that
was just a game on his part, as I said then, to throw
suspicion on me; an' anyhow, no ballots got in. He
says I stuffed it by a trick at the last. What's his
proof? He says so. Convincin'&mdash;hey? Gents, if
youse want to stop his bawlin', give him back his
marbles. Turn me down, an' youse'll have about
what's comin' to youse&mdash;a cry baby sport."</p>

<p>He kicked his chair back against the wall and sat
down; and amidst all the talk that followed he did
not once rise or turn his face direct to the crowd.
But when, finally, Brown said, "Everybody in favor
of the motion stand up," Foley rose to his full height
with his back against the wall, and his withheld gaze
now struck upon the crowd with startling effect. It
was a phenomenon of his close-set eyes that each man
in a crowd thought them fixed upon himself. Upon
every face that gaze seemed bent&mdash;lean, sarcastic,
menacing.</p>

<p>"Everybody that likes a cry baby sport, stand
up!" he shouted.</p>

<p>Men sprang up all over the hall, and stood so till
the count was made.</p>

<p>"Those opposed," Brown called out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>A number equally great rose noisily. A glance
showed Tom the motion was lost, since a two-thirds'
vote was necessary to rescind an action. But as his
hope had been small, his disappointment was now not
great.</p>

<p>Foley's supporters broke into cheers when they
saw their leader was safe, but Foley himself walked
with up-tilted cigar back to his first seat in an indifferent
silence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE ENTERTAINMENT COMMITTEE</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idcd.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="D" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">During the three weeks that followed
Tom kept busy day and night,&mdash;by day
looking for work and talking to chance-met
members, by night stirring the members
to appear on the first Wednesday of April to vote
for the demand for higher wages. He was much
of the time dogged by part of the entertainment
committee, but he had become watchful, and the
knowledge that he was armed made them wary, so
day after day passed without another conflict. At
first his committee's delay in the discharge of their
duty stirred Foley's wrath. "Youse're as slow as fat
angels!" he informed them in disgust. Later the
delay stirred his anxiety, and he raised his offer from
twenty-five dollars a man to one hundred.</p></div>

<p>Every night Tom was met at his street door by
Petersen and left there by him a few hours later.
His frequent appearance with Tom brought Petersen
into some prominence; and he was promptly nicknamed
"Babe" by a facetious member who had been
struck by his size, and "Rosie" by a man who saw
only his awkwardness. Both names stuck. His relation
to Tom had a more unpleasant result: it made
the story of his discomfiture by a man of half his
size, while on the fire-house job, decidedly worth the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
telling; and so it rapidly came into general circulation,
and the sight of Petersen was the signal for
jeers, even among Tom's own friends. Petersen
flushed at the taunts, but bore them dumbly and
kept his arms at his side.</p>

<p>All this while Ruth was much in Tom's mind.
Had it not been that he kept himself busy he could
have done little else but think of her. As it was, he
lay awake long hours at night, very quietly that he
might not rouse his wife, in wide-eyed dreams of her;
and several times by day he caught himself out of
thoughts of her to find himself in a street far out of
his way. And once, in the evening, he had puzzled
the faithful Petersen by walking back and forth
through an uptown block and gazing at a house in
which no member of the Iron Workers' Union could
possibly be living. But he held firmly to the course
he had recognized as his only course.</p>

<p>For three weeks he maintained his determination,
against desire scarcely less strong than his strength,
till the evening of the first Tuesday of April, the
night before the vote upon the strike. Then, either
he was weaker, or desire was stronger. He was
overwhelmed. His resolve to keep away from her,
his intention to spend this last evening in work, were
nothing before his wish to see her again. He was
fairly swept up to her door, not heeding Petersen,
and not giving a thought to Jake, whom he glimpsed
once in the street car behind when a brief blockade
let it gain the tail of his own.</p>

<p>"You needn't wait for me," he said mechanically
to Petersen as he rang the bell. Again the maid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
brought back word for him to come up. This time
Ruth was not waiting him at the head of the stairs.
He stood before her door a moment, with burning
brain, striving for mastery over himself, before he
could knock. She called to him to enter, and he
found her leaning against her little case of books,
unusually pale, but with eyes brighter than he had
ever seen them.</p>

<p>She took a step toward him, and held out her
hand. "I'm so glad you called, Mr. Keating."</p>

<p>Tom, for his part, could make no answer; his
throat had suddenly gone cracking dry. He took her
hand; his grip was as loose as an unconscious man's.</p>

<p>As was the first minute, so were the two hours that
followed. In answer to her questions he told her
of his new plans, without a vestige of enthusiasm;
and presently, to save the situation, she began to
talk volubly about nothing at all. They were hours
of mutual constraint. Tom hardly had knowledge
of what he said, and he hardly heard her words.
His very nearness to her made more ruthlessly clear
the wideness that lay between them. He felt with
its first keenness the utter hopelessness of his love.
Every moment that he sat with his hot eyes upon her
he realized that he should forthwith go. But still
he sat on in a silence of blissful agony.</p>

<p>At length there came an interruption&mdash;a knock at
the door. Ruth answered it, and when she turned
about she held out an envelope to Tom. "A letter
for you," she said, with a faint show of surprise.
"A messenger brought it."</p>

<p>Tom tore it open, looking first to the signature.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
It was from Pete. "I have got a bunch of the fellows
in the hall over the saloon at&mdash;Third Avenue,"
read the awkward scramble of words. "On the
third floor. Can't you come in and help me with
the spieling?"</p>

<p>At another time Tom might have wondered at this
note: how Pete had come to be in a hall with a
crowd of men, how Pete had learned where he was.
But now the note did not raise a doubt in his fevered
brain.</p>

<p>He folded the note, and put it into a pocket.
"I've got some work to do yet to-night," he explained,
and he took up his hat. It was an unusually
warm evening for the first of April and he had worn
no overcoat.</p>

<p>"You must come again soon," she said a few
moments later, as he was leaving. Tom had nothing
to say; he could not tell her the truth&mdash;that he
expected never to see her again. And so he left her,
awkwardly, without parting word of any kind. At
the foot of the stairs he paused and looked up at her
door, at the head of the first flight, and he looked
for a long, long space before he stepped forth into
the night.</p>

<p>A little round man stood bareheaded on the stoop;
Petersen was pacing slowly to and fro on the sidewalk.
The little man seized Tom by the arm.
"Won't you send a policeman, please," he asked
excitedly, in an inconsequential voice, such as belongs
properly to the husband of a boarding-house mistress.</p>

<p>"What for?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"That man there has been walking just so, back
and forth, for the last two hours. From the way
he keeps looking up at the house it is certain he is
contemplating some nefarious act of burglary."</p>

<p>"I'll do better than send a cop," said Tom. "I'll
take him away myself."</p>

<p>He went down the steps, took Petersen's arm and
started off with him. "Thank you exceedingly,
sir!" called out the little man.</p>

<p>They took an Eighty-sixth Street cross-town car
to Third Avenue, and after five minutes' riding
southward Tom, keeping watch from the end of the
car, spied a number near to the one for which he was
searching. They got out and easily found the place
designated in Pete's note. It was that great rarity,
a saloon in the middle of a New York block. The
windows of the second floor were dark; a soft glow
came through those of the floor above.</p>

<p>With the rattle of the elevated trains in their ears
Tom and Petersen entered the hallway which ran
alongside the saloon, and mounted two flights of
stairs so dark that, at the top of the second, Tom had
to grope for the door. This discovered, he opened
it and found himself at the rear of the hall. This
was a barren, dingy room, perhaps forty feet long,
with double curtains of some figured cloth at the
three front windows. Four men sat at the front
end of the room playing cards; there were glasses
and beer bottles on the table, and the men were
smoking.</p>

<p>All this Tom saw within the time of the snapping
of an instantaneous shutter; and he recognized, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
the same swiftness, that he had been trapped. But
before he could shift a foot to retreat, a terrific
shove from behind the door sent him staggering
against the side wall. The door was slammed shut
by the same force, grazing Petersen as he sprang in.
The bolt of the lock clicked into place.</p>

<p>"We've got youse this time!" Tom heard a
harsh voice cry out, and on the other side of Petersen,
who stood on guard with clenched fists, he saw
Jake Henderson, a heavy stick in his right hand.</p>

<p>In the same instant the men at the table had
sprung to their feet. "Why, if it ain't Rosie!" cried
Kaffir Bill, advancing at the head of the quartette.</p>

<p>"Say, fellows, tie my two hands behind me, so's
me an' Rosie can have an even fight," requested
Arkansas Number Two.</p>

<p>"If youse want Rosie to fight, youse've got to
tie his feet together," said Smoky; and this happy
reference to the time Petersen ran away brought a
laugh from the three others.</p>

<p>Tom, recovering from his momentary dizziness,
drew his revolver and levelled it at the four. "The
first man that moves gets the first bullet."</p>

<p>The men suddenly checked their steps.</p>

<p>For an instant the seven made a tableau. Then
Petersen sprang in at Jake. A blow from the club
on his left shoulder stopped him. Again he sprang
in, this time breaking through Jake's guard, but only
to grasp Jake's left arm with his half-numbed left
hand. This gave Jake his chance. His right hand
swung backward with the club, his eyes on Tom.</p>

<p>"Look out!" cried Petersen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom, guessing danger in the warning, pulled the
trigger. With a cry Hickey dropped to the floor,
a bullet in his leg. In the very flash of the revolver
the whizzing club sent the weapon flying from Tom's
hand. Tom made a rush after the pistol, and Jake,
breaking from Petersen's grip, made a plunge on
the same errand. Both outstretched hands closed
upon it, and the two men went sprawling to the floor
in a struggle for its possession.</p>

<p>Petersen faced quickly about upon the men whom
Tom's revolver had made hesitant. Hickey lay
groaning and swearing, a little pool of blood beginning
to form on the bare floor. The other three,
in their lust for their reward now so nearly won,
gave Hickey hardly a glance, but advanced upon
Petersen with the confidence that comes of being
three to one and of knowing that one to be a coward.
Petersen slipped off his coat, threw it together with
his derby hat upon the floor near the wall, and with
swelling nostrils quietly awaited their onslaught.</p>

<p>Arkansas stepped forth from his fellows.
"Where'll I hit you first, Rosie? Glad to give you
your pref'rence." And he spat into the V of Petersen's
vest.</p>

<p>That was the last conscious moment of Arkansas
for an hour. Petersen took a step forward, his long
arm shot out, and Arkansas went to the floor all
a-huddle.</p>

<p>Tom's eyes, glancing an instant from his own
adversary, saw the "Swedish Terror" of the photograph:
left foot advanced, fists on guard, body low-crouched.
"Come on!" Petersen said, with a joy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>ous
snarl, to the two men who had fallen back a
step. "Come on. I vant you bod!"</p>

<p>Kaffir Bill looked hesitantly upon his companion.
"It was only a lucky lick, Smoky; Arkansas wasn't
lookin'," he explained doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Yes," said the other.</p>

<p>"Sure. It couldn't 'a' been nothin' else. Why,
Kid Morgan done him up."</p>

<p>"Come on then!" cried Smoky.</p>

<p>Together they made a rush, Bill a step in advance.
Petersen's right landed over Bill's heart. Bill went
tottering backward and to the floor. Smoky shot
in and clinched; but after Petersen's fists, like alternating
hammers, had played a terrific tattoo against
his two cheeks, he loosed his hold and staggered
away with his arms about his ears. Bill rose dizzily
to his feet, and the pair leaned against the further
wall, whispering and watching Petersen with glowering
irresolution.</p>

<p>"Come on, bod! Come on vid you!" Petersen
shouted, his fists moving back and forth in invitation,
his indrawn breath snoring exultantly.</p>

<p>Jake let out an oath. "Get into him!" he said.</p>

<p>"Yah! Come on vid you!"</p>

<p>They conferred a moment longer, and then crept
forward warily. Hickey stopped his groaning and
rose to his elbows to watch the second round. At
five feet away the two paused. Then suddenly
Smoky made a feint, keeping out of reach of the
Swede's swinging return, and under cover of this
Kaffir Bill ducked and lunged at Petersen's legs.</p>

<p>Petersen went floundering to the floor, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
Smoky hurled himself upon his chest. The three
became a whirling, tumbling tangle,&mdash;arms striking
out, legs kicking,&mdash;Petersen now in under, now half
free, striking and hugging with long-untasted joy,
breathing fierce grunts and strange ejaculations.
The two had thought, once off his feet, the Swede
would be an easy conquest. But Petersen had been
a mighty rough-and-tumble scrapper before he had
gone into the prize ring, and for a few tumultuous
moments the astounded twain had all they could do
to hold their own.</p>

<p>"Slug him, can't youse!" gasped Bill, who was
looking after Petersen's lower half, to Smoky, who
was looking after the upper.</p>

<p>Smoky likewise saw that only a blow in the right
place could give them victory over this heaving force.
So far it had taken his best to hold these long
arms. But he now loosed his hug to get in the victorious
blow. Before he could strike, Petersen's
fist jammed him in the face.</p>

<p>"Ya-a-h!" grunted the Swede.</p>

<p>Smoky fell instantly to his old position. "Hit
him yourself!" he growled from Petersen's shirt
front.</p>

<p>Bill, not having seen what had happened to
Smoky, released a leg so that he might put his fist
into Petersen's stomach. The leg kicked his knee.
Bill, with a shriek, frantically re-embraced the leg.</p>

<p>The two now saw they could do no more than
merely hold Petersen, and so the struggle settled to
a stubborn equilibrium.</p>

<p>In the meantime the strife between Tom and Jake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
had been like that of two bulls which stand braced,
with locked horns. Jake's right hand had gained
possession of the revolver, having at first had the
better hold on it; Tom had a fierce grip on his
forearm. The whole effort of one was to put the
weapon into use; the whole effort of the other was to
prevent its use, and perhaps to seize it for himself.
Neither dared strike lest the act give the other his
chance.</p>

<p>When he saw nothing was coming of the struggle
between Bill and Smoky and Petersen, a glimpse of
the wounded man, raised on his elbows, gave Jake
an idea. With a jerk of his wrist he managed to toss
the revolver a couple of feet away, beyond his own
and Tom's reach.</p>

<p>"Hickey!" he called out. "Get it!"</p>

<p>The wounded man moved toward them, half
crawling, half dragging himself. A vengeful look
came into his eyes. Tom needed no one to tell him
what would happen when the man he had shot laid
hand upon his weapon. Hickey drew nearer and
nearer, his bloody trouser leg leaving a moist trail
on the bare floor. His head reached their feet&mdash;passed
them&mdash;his right hand stretched out for the
revolver. Tom saw his only chance. With a
supreme effort he turned Jake, who in watching
Hickey was momentarily off his guard, upon his
back; and with all the strength of his leg he drove
his foot into the crawling man's stomach. The man
collapsed with a groaning outrush of breath.</p>

<p>Tom saw that the deadlock was likely to be ended,
and the victory won, by the side gaining possession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
of the revolver; and he saw the danger to Petersen
and himself that lay in the possibility of either of the
unconscious men regaining his senses. Petersen's
slow mind worked rapidly enough in a fight; he, too,
saw the danger Tom had seen. Anything to be done
must be done at once.</p>

<p>But a nearer danger presented itself. Jake strained
his neck till his eyes were on the trio. "Can't
one o' youse hold him?" he gasped. "T'other git
the gun."</p>

<p>Smoky was on his back crosswise beneath Petersen's
chest, his arms tight about Petersen's neck,
clamping Petersen's hot cheek against his own. Kaffir
Bill lay upon the Swede's legs, arms locked about
them just below the hips. Bill was the freer to obey
the order of the chief, and he began to slip his arms,
still embracing the legs, slowly downward.</p>

<p>Certainly anything to be done must be done at
once, for Petersen, lost to passion though he was,
knew that in another moment Bill's arms would have
slipped to his feet, and there would be a spring to be
clear of his kick and a rush for the revolver. With
a fierce grunt, he quickly placed his broad hands on
either side of Smoky's chest and slowly strained
upward. Bill, not knowing what this new move
meant, immediately regripped Petersen's thighs.
Slowly Petersen rose, lifting Smoky's stiffened body
after him, cheek still tight against cheek, till his
elbows locked. Then his hips gradually raised till
part of his weight was on his knees. His back
arched upward, and his whole body stiffened till it
was like a bar of iron.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>Suddenly his arms relaxed, and he drove downward,
his weight and strength concentrated against
Smoky's cheek. Smoky's head battered the floor.
His arms loosened; a quick blow on the jaw made
them fall limp. Petersen whirled madly over to dispose
of Bill, but in the same tick of the watch Bill
sprang away, and to his feet, and made a dash for
the revolver. Instantly Petersen was up and but
two paces behind him. Bill's lunging hand fell upon
the weapon, Petersen's fist fell upon Bill, and the
revolver was Petersen's.</p>

<p>When Jake saw Petersen come up with the pistol
he took his arms from about Tom. "Youse've got
me done. I give in," he growled.</p>

<p>The two were rising when a wild voice sounded
out hoarsely: "Come on! Come on now vid you!"</p>

<p>Tom, on his feet, turned toward Petersen. The
Swede, left hand gripping the revolver about its
barrel, stood in challenging attitude, his eyes blazing,
saliva trickling from one corner of his mouth.
"Yah! Come on!"</p>

<p>Tom recognized what he was seeing,&mdash;that wild
Swedish rage that knows neither when it has beat
nor when it is beaten; in this case all the less controllable
from its long restraint.</p>

<p>Pete, Smoky, and Bill were now all on their feet
and leaning against the wall. Petersen strode glaring
before them, shaking his great fists madly.
"Come on now!"</p>

<p>"Petersen!" Tom called.</p>

<p>"Come on vid you! I vant all dree!" The harsh
voice rose into a shriek.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>The three did not move. "For God's sake, Petersen!
The fight's over!" Tom cried.</p>

<p>"Afraid! Yah! Afraid! I lick you all dree!"</p>

<p>With an animal-like roar he rushed at the three
men. Smoky and Bill ducked and dashed away,
but Jake stood his ground and put up his fists. A
blow and he went to the floor. Petersen flung about
to make for Smoky and Bill. Tom seized his arm.</p>

<p>"God, man! Stop! They've give in!"</p>

<p>"Look out!" A shove sent Tom staggering, and
Petersen was away. "I lick 'em all, by God!" he
roared.</p>

<p>With annihilating intent he bore down upon Bill
and Smoky, who stood back to wall on fearful defense.
An inspiration flashed upon Tom. "Your
wife, Petersen! Your wife!" he cried.</p>

<p>Petersen's raging strides checked. He looked
slowly about. "Vot?"</p>

<p>"Your wife!"</p>

<p>"Anna!... Anna!" Dazed, breathing
heavily, he stared at Tom. Something like a convulsion
went through him. His face faded to dullness,
then to contrition.</p>

<p>"Better let me have the gun," Tom said quietly,
after a minute had passed.</p>

<p>Petersen handed it over.</p>

<p>"Now get your hat and coat, and we'll go."</p>

<p>Without glancing at the three, who were staring
at him in utter bewilderment, Petersen dully put on
his hat and coat. A moment later he and Tom were
backing toward the door. But before they reached
it Tom's steady gaze became conscious of the cur<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>tains
at the further end of the room. His square
face tightened grimly with sudden purpose.</p>

<p>"Take down those curtains, Petersen," he said.</p>

<p>Petersen removed the six curtains, dusty and
stained with tobacco juice, from their places and
brought them to Tom.</p>

<p>"Tear five of 'em into two strips."</p>

<p>The three men, and Hickey from the floor, looked
on curiously while Petersen obeyed.</p>

<p>"Tie Jake up first; hands behind his back," was
Tom's next order.</p>

<p>"I'll see youse in hell first!" Jake backed away
from Petersen and raised his fists.</p>

<p>"If you make any trouble, I'll give you a quick
chance to look around there a bit!"</p>

<p>Jake gazed a moment at the revolver and the
gleaming eye behind it, and his fists dropped. Petersen
stepped behind him and went to work, twisting
the strip of muslin into a rope as he wound it about
Jake's wrists. The job was securely done in a
minute, for Petersen had once followed the sea.</p>

<p>"Now his feet," said Tom; and to Jake: "It'll
be easier for you if you lay down."</p>

<p>Jake hesitated, then with an oath dropped to his
knees and tumbled awkwardly on his side. In
another minute Jake's feet were fastened; and at the
end of ten minutes the other four men had been
bound, even the wounded Hickey.</p>

<p>Tom put his revolver in his outside coat pocket,
and unlocked the door. "Good-night," he said; and
he and Petersen stepped out. He locked the door
and put the key in his pocket.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>"Police?" asked Petersen, when they had gained
the street.</p>

<p>"No. That's what they ought to have. But
when you've been a union man longer you'll know we
boys don't ask the police to mix in our affairs. When
there's a strike, they're always turned against us by
the bosses. So we leave 'em alone."</p>

<p>They were but half a dozen squares from Mulligan's
saloon. Tom set out in its direction, and five
minutes later, with Petersen behind him, he walked
into the doorway of the room beyond the bar. As
he had expected, there sat Foley, and with him were
three of his men. Foley started, and half rose from
his chair, but settled back again. His discomposure
confirmed what Tom had already guessed&mdash;that
Foley's was the brain behind the evening's stratagem,
and that he was awaiting his deputies' report.</p>

<p>"I guess you were expecting somebody else," Tom
said grimly from the doorway, one hand on the
revolver in his coat pocket. "I just dropped in to
tell you Jake Henderson and his bunch are waiting
for you up over Murphy's saloon."</p>

<p>Foley was dazed, as he could not help but be,
thus learning his last plan had failed. "Youse saw
'em?"</p>

<p>"I did."</p>

<p>He looked Tom over. And then his eyes took in
the figure of Petersen just within the doorway. He
grasped instinctively at the chance to raise a laugh.
"Was Rosie there?" he queried.</p>

<p>The three dutifully guffawed.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Tom. "Rosie was there."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>Foley took a bracing hold of himself, and toyed
with the stem of his beer glass. "Much obliged for
comin' in to tell me," he said, with a show of carelessness.
"But I guess the boys ain't in no hurry."</p>

<p>"No, I guess not," Tom agreed. "They said
they'd wait till you came."</p>

<p>With that he tossed the key upon the table,
turned and strode forth from the saloon. Outside
he thrust a gripping arm through Petersen's, which
straightway took on an embarrassed limpness, and
walked away.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<div class="drop">

<p class="cap_1">Tom mounted the stairs of Potomac Hall
early the next evening. During the day
he had told a few friends the story of the
encounter of the night before. The story
had spread in versions more or less vague and distorted,
and now on his entry of the hall he was
beset by a crowd who demanded a true and detailed
account of the affair. This he gave.</p></div>

<p>"Oh, come now, Tom! This's hot air you're
handin' us out about Babe!" expostulated one of the
men.</p>

<p>"It's the truth."</p>

<p>"Get out! I saw Kid Morgan chase him a block.
He can't fight."</p>

<p>"You think not? Well, there's one way you can
convince yourself."</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Try it with him for about a minute," answered
Tom.</p>

<p>There was a laugh, in which the man joined. "I
tell you what, boys," he said, after it had subsided.
"I hit Babe on the back o' the neck with a glove the
day Kid chased him. If what Tom says is straight,
I'm goin' to beg Babe's pardon in open meetin'."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>"Me, too," chimed in another.</p>

<p>"It's so," said Tom, thinking with a smile of
what was in store for Petersen.</p>

<p>For some reason, perhaps one having to do with
their personal pride, Jake and his fellows did not
appear that night, though several hundred men waited
their coming with impatient greetings. But just
before Tom opened the session Petersen entered
the hall and slipped into an obscure seat near the
door.</p>

<p>He was immediately recognized. "Petersen!"
someone announced. Straightway men arose all
over the hall and turned about to face him. "Petersen!"
"Petersen!" "What's the matter with
Petersen!" the cries went up, and there was a great
clapping of hands.</p>

<p>Petersen sprang to his feet in wild consternation.
Yes, they were looking at him. Yes, that was his
name. He didn't know what it meant&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But the next instant he had bolted out of the hall.</p>

<p>When the shouting had died away Tom called the
union to order. He was filled with an exultant sense
of certain triumph; he had kept an estimating eye
on the members as they had filed in; an easy
majority of the men were with him, and as their
decision would be by open vote there would be no
chance for Foley to stuff a ballot-box.</p>

<p>Pete, the instructed spokesman for Tom's party,
was the first man on his feet. "Mr. President," he
said, "I move we drop the reg'lar order o' business
an' proceed at once to new business."</p>

<p>Tom put the motion to rising vote. His con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>fidence
grew as he looked about the hall, for the
rising vote on the motion showed how strong his
majority really was.</p>

<p>"Motion carried!" he shouted, and brought
down his gavel.</p>

<p>The next instant a dozen men were on their feet
waving their right hands and crying, "Mr. Chairman."
One was Pete, ten were good-intentioned but
uninformed friends, and one was Foley. Tom's
eyes fastened upon Foley, and his mind worked
quickly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Foley," he said.</p>

<p>A murmur of surprise ran among Tom's friends.
But he had his reason for this slight deviation from
his set plan. He knew that Foley was opposed to a
strike; if he let Foley go on record against it in a
public speech, then his coming victory over the walking
delegate would be all the more decisive.</p>

<p>Foley looked slowly about upon the men, and for
a moment did not speak. Then he said suddenly, in
a conversational tone: "Boys, how much youse
gettin'?"</p>

<p>"Three seventy-five," several voices answered.</p>

<p>"How long youse been gettin' it?"</p>

<p>"Two years."</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, his voice rising and ringing with
intensity. "Two years youse've been workin' for
three seventy-five. The bosses' profits have been
growin' bigger an' bigger. But not a cent's raise
have youse had. Not a cent, boys! Now here's
what I say."</p>

<p>He paused, and thrust out his right arm impres<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>sively.
Tom regarded him in sickened, half-comprehending
amazement.</p>

<p>"Here's what I say, boys! I say it's time we had
more money. I say we ought to make the blood-suckin'
bosses give up a part o' what's comin' to us.
That's what I say!" And he swung his doubled
fist before his face in a great semi-circle.</p>

<p>He turned to Tom, with a leer in his eyes that was
for Tom alone. "Mr. President, I move we demand
a ten per cent. increase o' wages, an' if the bosses
won't give it, strike for it!"</p>

<p>Tom sank stupefied back in his chair. Foley's
own men were bewildered utterly. A dead silence
of a minute or more reigned in the hall, while all but
the walking delegate strove to recover their bearing.</p>

<p>It was Connelly who broke the general trance.
Connelly did not understand, but there was Foley's
standing order, "Watch me, an' do the same." "I
second the motion," he said.</p>

<p>A little later Foley's strike measure was carried
without a single dissenting vote. Foley, Connelly,
Brown, Pete, and Tom, with Foley as chairman, were
elected the committee to negotiate with the employers
for higher wages, and, if there should be a strike,
to manage it.</p>

<p>The adoption of the strike measure meant to Foley
that the income derived from Mr. Baxter, and two or
three others with whom he maintained somewhat similar
relations, was to be cut off. But before he
reached home that night he had discovered a compensation
for this loss, and he smiled with grim satisfaction.
The next morning he presented himself in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
the office of Mr. Baxter, and this same grim smile
was on his face.</p>

<p>"Hello, Baxter! How youse stackin' up this
mornin'?" And he clapped a hand on Mr. Baxter's
artistically padded shoulder.</p>

<p>The contractor started at this familiarity, and a
slight frown showed itself on his brow. "Very well,"
he said shortly.</p>

<p>"Really, now. Why, youse look like youse slept
alongside a bad dream." Foley drew forth his cigar-case
and held it out. He knew Mr. Baxter did not
smoke cigars and hated their smell.</p>

<p>"No, thank you."</p>

<p>The walking delegate put one in his mouth and
scratched a match under the edge of the cherry table.
"I don't s'pose youse know there was doin's at the
union last night?"</p>

<p>"I understand the union decided to strike."</p>

<p>"Wonderful, ain't it, how quick news travels?"</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter disregarded Foley's look of mock surprise.
"You seem to have failed utterly to keep
your promise that there would be no strike," he said
coldly.</p>

<p>"It was Keating stirred it up," Foley returned,
calmly biting a bit off his cigar and blowing it out
upon the deep red rug.</p>

<p>"You also failed to stop Mr. Keating," Mr. Baxter
pursued.</p>

<p>"Mr. Baxter, even the best of us makes our mistakes.
I bet even youse ain't cheated every man
youse've counted on cheatin'."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter gave another little start, as when Foley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
had slapped his shoulder. "Furthermore, I understand
you, yourself, made the motion to strike."</p>

<p>"The way youse talk sometimes, Baxter, makes
me think youse must 'a' been born about minute before
last," Foley returned blandly. "As an amachure
diplomat, youse've got Mayor Low skinned to death.
Sure I made the motion. An' why did I make the
motion? If I hadn't 'a' made it, but had opposed
it, where'd I 'a' been? About a thousand miles outside
the outskirts o' nowhere,&mdash;nobody in the union,
an' consequently worth about as much to youse as a
hair in a bowl o' soup. I stood to lose both. I still
got the union."</p>

<p>"What do you propose that we do?" Mr. Baxter
held himself in, for the reason that he supposed
the old relation would merely give place to a new.</p>

<p>"Well, there's goin' to be strike. The union'll
make a demand, an' I rather guess youse'll not give
up without a fight."</p>

<p>"We shall certainly fight," Mr. Baxter assured
him.</p>

<p>"Well," he drawled, "since I've got to lead the
union in a strike an' youse're goin' to fight the strike,
it seems like everything'd have to be off between us,
don't it?"</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter did not reply at once, and then did not
answer the question. "What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>"To tell youse, that is just what I came here for."
In a flash Foley's manner changed from the playful
to the vindictive, and he leaned slowly forward in
his chair. "I'm goin' to fight youse, Baxter, an' fight
youse like hell!" he said, between barely parted teeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
And his gray eyes, suddenly hard, gazed maliciously
into Mr. Baxter's face.</p>

<p>"I'm goin' to fight like hell!" he went on. "For
two years I've been standin' your damned manicured
manners. Youse've acted like I wasn't fit to touch.
Why d'youse s'pose I've stood it? Because it was
money to me. Now that there's no money in it,
d'youse s'pose I'm goin' to stand it any longer? Not
much, by God! And d'youse think I've forgotten
the past&mdash;your high-nosed, aristocratic ways? Well,
youse'll remember 'em too! My chance's come, an'
I'm goin' to fight youse like hell!"</p>

<p>At the last Foley's clenched fist was under Mr.
Baxter's nose. The contractor did not stir the
breadth of a hair. "Mr. Foley," he said in his cold,
even voice, "I think you know the shortest way out
of this office."</p>

<p>"I do," said Foley. "An' it's a damned sight too
long!"</p>

<p>He gave Mr. Baxter a long look, full of defiant
hate, contemptuously flipped his half-smoked cigar
on Mr. Baxter's spotless desk, and strode out.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">FOLEY TASTES REVENGE</p>
<div class="drop">

<p class="cap_1">Foley's threat that, under cover of the
strike, he was going to make Mr. Baxter
suffer, was anything save empty bluster.
But twenty years of fighting had made
him something of a connoisseur of vengeance. He
knew, for instance, that a moment usually presented
itself when revenge was most effective and when it
tasted sweetest. So he now waited for time to bring
him that moment; and he waited all the more
patiently because a month must elapse ere the beginning
of the strike would afford him his chance.</p></div>

<p>The month passed dully. Buck had spoken from
certain knowledge when he had remarked to Mr.
Baxter that the contractors would not yield without a
fight. During April there were no less than half a
dozen meetings between the union's committee and
the Executive Committee of the employers' association
in a formal attempt at peaceful settlement. The
public attitude of Foley and Baxter toward each other
for the past two years had been openly hostile. That
attitude was not changed, but it was now sincere. In
these meetings the unionists presented their case; the
employers gave their side; every point, pro and con,
was gone over again and again. On the thirtieth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
April the situation was just as it had been on the first:
"We're goin' to get all we're askin' for," said Foley;
"We can concede nothing," said Mr. Baxter. On
the first of May not a man was at work on an iron
job in New York City.</p>

<p>During these four weeks Foley regained popularity
with an astounding rapidity. He was again the
Foley of four or five years ago, the Foley that had
won the enthusiastic admiration of the union, fierce-tongued
in his denunciation of the employers at
union meetings, grimly impudent to members of the
employers' Executive Committee and matching their
every argument,&mdash;at all times witty, resourceful,
terribly determined, fairly hurling into others a confidence
in himself. He was feeling with almost its
first freshness the joy of being in, and master of, a
great fight. Men that for years had spoken of him
only in hate, now cheered him. And even Tom himself
had to yield to this new Foley a reluctant admiration,
he was so tireless, so aggressive, so equal to
the occasion.</p>

<p>Tom had become, by the first of May, a figure of
no importance. True, he was a member of the strike
committee, but Foley gave him no chance to speak;
and, anyhow, the walking delegate said what there
was to be said so pointedly, albeit with a virulence
that antagonized the employers all the more, that
there was no reason for his saying aught. And as
for his position as president, that had become pathetically
ludicrous. As though in opposite pans of a
balance, the higher Foley went in the union's estimation,
the lower went he. Even his own friends, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
not abandoning him, fell in behind Foley. He was
that pitiable anomaly, a leader without a following
and without a cause. Foley had stolen both. He
tried to console himself with the knowledge that the
walking delegate was managing the strike for the
union's good; but only the millionth man has so little
personal ambition that he is content to see the work
he would do being well done by another....
And yet, though fallen, he hung obstinately on and
waited&mdash;blindly.</p>

<p>Tom was now in little danger from the entertainment
committee, for Foley's disquiet over his influence
had been dissipated by his rapid decline. And after
the first of May Tom gave Foley even less concern,
for he had finally secured work in the shipping
department of a wholesale grocer, so could no longer
show himself by day among the union men.</p>

<p>During April the contractors had prepared for the
coming fight by locating non-union ironworkers, and
during the first part of May they rushed these into the
city and set them to work, guarded by Pinkerton
detectives, upon the most pressing jobs. The union,
in its turn, picketed every building on which there
was an attempt to continue work, and against the
scabs the pickets waged a more or less pacific warfare.
Foley was of himself as much as all the pickets. He
talked to the non-union men as they came up to their
work, as they left their work, as they rode away on
street cars, as they sat in saloons. Some he reached
by his preachment of the principles of trade unionism.
And some he reached by such brief speech as this:
"This strike'll be settled soon. Our men'll all go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
back to work. What'll happen to youse about then?
The bosses'll kick youse out. If youse're wise
youse'll join the union and help us in the strike."
This argument was made more effective by the temporary
lifting of the initiation fee of twenty-five
dollars, by which act scabs were made union men
without price. There was also a third method, which
Foley called "transmittin' unionism to the brain by
the fist," and he reached many this way, for his fist
was heavy and had a strong arm behind it.</p>

<p>The contractors, in order to retain the non-union
men, raised their wages to fifty cents a day more than
the union demanded, but even then they were able
to hold only enough workers to keep a few jobs going
in half-hearted fashion. There were many accidents
and delays on these buildings, for the workers were
boilermakers, and men who but half knew the trade,
and men who did not know the trade at all. As
Pete remarked, after watching, from a neighboring
roof, the gang finishing up the work on the St. Etienne
Hotel, "The shadder of an ironworker would do
more'n three o' them snakes." The contractors
themselves realized perfectly what poor work they
were getting for so extravagant a price, and would
have discharged their non-union gangs had this not
been a tacit admission of partial defeat.</p>

<p>From the first of May there of course had been
several hot-heads who favored violent handling of
the scabs. Tom opposed these with the remnant
of his influence, for he knew the sympathy of the
public has its part in the settlement of strikes, and
public sympathy goes not to the side guilty of outrage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
The most rabid of all these advocates of violence was
Johnson, who, after being summoned to Mr. Baxter's
office, began diligently to preach this substance: "If
we put a dozen or two o' them snakes out o' business,
an' fix a job or two, the bosses'll come right to time."</p>

<p>"It strikes me, Johnson, that you change your
ideas about as often as you ought to change your
shirt," Pete remarked one day, after listening to
Johnson's inflammatory words. "Not long ago you
were all against a strike."</p>

<p>For a moment Johnson was disconcerted. Then
he said: "But since there is a strike I'm for measures
that'll settle it quick. What you got against smashin'
a few scabs?"</p>

<p>"Oh, it's always right to smash a scab," Pete
agreed. "But you ought to know that just now
there's nothin' the bosses'd rather have us do. They'd
pay good money to get us to give the hospitals a
chance to practice up on a few snakes."</p>

<p>Johnson looked at Pete searchingly, fearing that
Pete suspected. But Pete guessed nothing, and Johnson
went about his duty.</p>

<p>There were a number of encounters between the
strikers and the strike-breakers, and several of these
set-tos had an oral repetition in the police courts; but
nothing occurred so serious as to estrange public sympathy
till the explosion in the Avon, a small apartment
house Mr. Baxter was erecting as a private
investment. And with this neither Johnson nor the
rank and file, on whose excitable feelings he tried to
play, had anything to do.</p>

<p>Foley's patience mastered his desire for vengeance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
easily enough during April, but when May had
reached its middle without offering the chance he
wanted, his patience weakened and desire demanded
its rights. At an utterly futile meeting between the
committees of the union and the employers, toward the
end of the month, arranged for by the Civic Federation,
the desire for vengeance suddenly became the
master. This was the first meeting since the strike
began, and was the first time Foley had seen Mr.
Baxter since then. The contractor did not once look
at Foley, and did not once address speech to him; he
sat with his back to the walking delegate, and put all
his remarks to Brown, the least important member of
the strikers' committee. Foley gave as good as he
received, for he selected Isaacs, who was nothing
more than a fifth man, and addressed him as head of
the employers' committee; and rather better, for he
made Mr. Baxter the object of a condescending affability
that must have been as grateful as salt to raw
and living flesh.</p>

<p>But Foley was not appeased. When he and Connelly
were clear of the meeting he swore fiercely.
"He won't be so cool to-morrow!" he said, and
swore again. "An' the same trick'll help bring 'em
all to time," he added.</p>

<p>Foley had already had vengeful eyes upon the
Avon, which stood on a corner with a vacant lot on
one side and an open space between its rear and the
next building. Jake had carefully reconnoitered its
premises, with the discovery that one of the two
Pinkerton guards was an acquaintance belonging to
the days when he himself had been in the service of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the Pinkerton agency. That night Jake sauntered by
the Avon, chatted awhile with the two guards, and
suggested a visit to a nearby saloon. As soon as the
three were safely around the corner Kaffir Bill and
Arkansas Number Two slipped into the doorway of
the Avon, leaving Smoky on watch without. Bill
and Arkansas had their trouble: to find their way
about in the darkness, to light the fuse&mdash;and then they
had to cut off an unignitable portion of the fuse;
and then in their nervous eagerness to get away their
legs met a barrel of cement and they went sprawling
behind a partition. Several moments passed ere they
found the doorway, the while they could hear the
sputtering of the shortened fuse, and during which
they heard Smoky cry out, "Come on!" When
they did come into the street it was to see the two
Pinkertons not twenty paces away. Before their
haste could take them to the opposite sidewalk the
pavement jumped under their feet, and the building
at their backs roared heavily. The guards, guessing
the whole trick, began shooting at the two. A policeman
appeared from around the corner with drawn
pistol&mdash;and that night Jake, Bill, and Arkansas slept
in a cell.</p>

<p>The next morning, after getting on the car that
carried him to his work, Tom took up his paper with
a leisure that straightway left him, for his eyes were
instantly caught by the big headlines sketching the
explosion in the Avon. He raced through the three
columns. He could see Foley behind the whole outrage,
and he thrilled with satisfaction as he foresaw
the beginning of Foley's undoing in the police court.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
There was no work for him that morning. He
leaped off the car and took another that brought
him near the court where the three men were to have
their preliminary hearing.</p>

<p>It was half-past eight when he reached the court.
As he entered the almost empty court-room he saw
Foley and a black-maned man of lego-theatric appearance
standing before a police sergeant, and he heard
Foley say: "This is their lawyer; we want to see
'em straight off." Tom preferred to avoid meeting
Foley, so he turned quickly back and walked about
for half an hour. When he returned the small court-room
was crowded, the clerks were in place, the policemen
and their prisoners stood in a long queue having
its head at the judge's desk and its tail without the
iron railing that fenced off the spectators.</p>

<p>Tom had been in the court-room but a few minutes
when an officer motioned him within the railing. The
court attorney stepped to his side. "You were
pointed out to me as the president of the Iron
Workers' Union," said the attorney.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And I was told you didn't care particularly for
the prisoners in this explosion case."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Would you be willing to testify against them&mdash;not
upon the explosion, which you didn't see, but upon
their character?"</p>

<p>Tom looked at Jake, Arkansas, and Bill, standing
at the head of the queue in charge of the two Pinkertons
and a couple of policemen, and struggled a
moment with his thoughts. Ordinarily it was a point<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
of honor with a union man not to aid the law against
a fellow member; but this was not an ordinary case.
The papers had thrown the whole blame for the outrage
upon the union. The union's innocence could
be proved only by fastening the blame upon Foley
and the three prisoners.</p>

<p>"I will," he consented.</p>

<p>There was a tiresome wait for the judge. About
ten o'clock he emerged from his chambers and took
his place upon his platform. He was a cold-looking
man, with an aristocratic face, deeply marked with
lines of hard justice, and with a time-tonsured pate.
His enemies, and they were many, declared his judgments
ignored the law; his answer was that he administered
the law according to common sense, and
not according to its sometimes stupid letter.</p>

<p>The bailiff opened the court, and the case of Jake,
Arkansas, and Bill was called. The two Pinkertons
recited the details of the explosion and the two
policemen added details of the arrest. Then Mr.
Baxter, looking pale, but as much the self-controlled
gentleman as ever, testified to the damage done by
the dynamite. The Avon still stood, but its steel
frame was so wrenched at the base that it was liable
to fall at any moment. The building would have
to be reconstructed entirely. Though much of the
material could be used again, the loss, at a conservative
estimate, would be seventy-five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Tom came next before the judge's desk. Exclamations
of surprise ran among the union men in the room
when it was seen Tom was to be a witness, and the
bailiff had to pound with his gavel and shout for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
order. Tom testified that the three were known in
the union as men ready for any villainy; and he managed
to introduce in his answers to the questions
enough to make it plain that the union was in no
degree responsible for the outrage, that it abhorred
such acts, that responsibility rested upon the
three&mdash;"And someone else," he added meaningly.</p>

<p>"Who's that?" quickly demanded the court
attorney.</p>

<p>"Buck Foley."</p>

<p>"I object!" shouted the prisoners' attorney.
Foley, who sat back in the crowd with crossed legs,
did not alter his half-interested expression by a
wrinkle.</p>

<p>"Objection over-ruled," said the judge.</p>

<p>"Will you please tell what you know about Mr.
Foley's connection with the case," continued the
court attorney.</p>

<p>"I object, your Honor! Mr. Foley is not on
trial."</p>

<p>"It's the duty of this court to get at all the facts,"
returned the judge. "Does the witness speak from
his own knowledge, or what he surmises?"</p>

<p>"I'm absolutely certain he's at the bottom of this."</p>

<p>"But is your evidence first-hand information?"</p>

<p>"It is not," Tom had to confess. "But I couldn't
be more certain if I had seen him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Guess-work isn't evidence," cut in the judge.</p>

<p>Tom, however, had attached Foley to the case&mdash;he
had seen the reporters start at his words as at a fresh
sensation&mdash;and he gave a look of satisfaction at Foley
as he stepped away from the judge's desk. Foley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
gave back a half-covered sneer, as if to say, "Just
youse wait!"</p>

<p>Arkansas was the first of the prisoners to be called&mdash;the
reason for which priority, as Tom afterwards
guessed, being his anomalous face that would not have
ill-suited a vest that buttoned to the chin and a collar
that buttoned at the back. Arkansas, replying to
the questions of his long-haired attorney, corroborated
the testimony of the policemen and the Pinkertons in
every detail. When Arkansas had answered the last
query the lawyer allowed several seconds to pass, his
figure drawn up impressively, his right hand in the
breast of his frock coat.</p>

<p>The judge bent over his docket and began to write.
"This seems a perfectly plain case. I hold the three
prisoners for the grand jury, each in ten thousand&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The attorney's right hand raised itself theatrically.
"Hold!" he cried.</p>

<p>The judge looked up with a start. Tom's eyes,
wandering to Foley's face, met there a malign grin.</p>

<p>"The case is not ended, your Honor. The case is
just begun." The attorney brushed back his mane
with a stagy movement of his hand, and turned upon
Arkansas. "You and the other prisoners did this.
You do not deny it. But now tell his Honor why you
did it."</p>

<p>Arkansas, with honesty fairly obtruding from his
every feature, looked nervously at Tom, and then
said hesitantly: "Because we had to."</p>

<p>"And why did you have to?"</p>

<p>Again Arkansas showed hesitation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Speak out," encouraged the attorney. "You're
in no danger. The court will protect you."</p>

<p>"We was ordered to. If we hadn't done it we'd
been thrown out o' the union, an' been done up."</p>

<p>"Explain to the court what you mean by 'done
up'."</p>

<p>"Slugged an' kicked&mdash;half killed."</p>

<p>"In other words, what you did was done in fear
of your life. Now who ordered you to blow up the
Avon, and threatened to have you 'done up' if you
didn't?"</p>

<p>"Mr. Keating, the president o' the union."</p>

<p>The judge, who had been leaning forward with
kindling eyes, breathed a prolonged "A-a-ah!"</p>

<p>For a moment Tom was astounded. Then he
sprang to Arkansas's side. "You infernal liar!" he
shouted, his eyes blazing.</p>

<p>The judge's hammer thundered down. "Silence!"
he roared.</p>

<p>"But, your Honor, he's lying!"</p>

<p>"Five dollars for contempt of court! Another
word and I'll give you the full penalty."</p>

<p>Two officers jerked Tom back, and surging with
indignant wrath he had to listen in silence to the
romance that had been spun for Arkansas's lips and
which he was now respinning for the court's ears;
and he quickly became aware that newspaper artists
had set their pencils busy over his face. Once,
glancing at Jake, he was treated with a leer of
triumph.</p>

<p>Arkansas plausibly related what had passed between
Tom and himself and his two companions; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
then Bill took the stand, and then Jake. Each repeated
the story Arkansas, with the help of his face,
had made so convincing.</p>

<p>"And now, your Honor," the prisoners' attorney
began when his evidence was all in, "I think I have
made plain my clients' part in this most nefarious
outrage. They are guilty&mdash;yes. But they were but
the all too weak instruments of another's will, who
galvanized them by mortal fear to do his dastardly
bidding. He, he alone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Save your eloquence, councilor," the judge broke
in. "The case speaks best for itself. You here."
He crooked his forefinger at Tom.</p>

<p>Tom was pushed by policemen up before the judge.</p>

<p>"Now what have you to say for yourself?" the judge
demanded.</p>

<p>"It's one string of infernal lies!" Tom exploded.
And he launched into a hot denial, strong in phrasing
but weak in comparison with the inter-corroborative
stones of the three, which had the further verisimilitude
gained by tallying in every detail with the
officers' account of the explosion.</p>

<p>"What you say is merely denial, the denial we
hear from every criminal," his Honor began when
Tom had finished. "I do not say I believe every
word of the testimony of the three prisoners. But
it is more credible than your statements.</p>

<p>"What has been brought out here to-day&mdash;the
supreme officer of a union compelling members to
commit an act of violence by threat of economic disablement
and of physical injury, perhaps death&mdash;is
in perfect accord with the many diabolical practices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
that have recently been revealed as existing among
trade unions. It is such things as this that force all
right-minded men to regard trade unionism as the
most menacing danger which our nation now confronts."
And for five minutes he continued in his
arraignment of trade unions.</p>

<p>"In the present circumstances," he ended, "it is
my duty to order the arrest of this man who appears
to be the chief conspirator&mdash;this president of a union
who has had the supreme hardihood to appear as a
witness against his own tools, doubtless hoping
thereby to gain the end of the thief who cried 'stop
thief.' I hold him in fifteen thousand dollars bond to
await the action of the grand jury. The three prisoners
are held in five thousand dollars bail each."</p>

<p>Jake, Bill, and Arkansas were led away by their
captors, and Tom, utterly dazed by this new disaster
that had overtaken him when he had thought there
was nothing more that could befall, was shoved over
to the warrant clerk. And again he caught Foley's
eyes; they were full of malicious satisfaction.</p>

<p>As he waited before the warrant clerk's desk he
saw Mr. Baxter, on his way to the door, brush by
Foley, and in the moment of passing he saw Foley's
lips move. He did not hear Foley's words. They
were two, and were: "First round!"</p>

<p>A few minutes later Tom was led down a stairway,
through a corridor and locked in a cell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap_1">Late in the afternoon, as Tom lay stretched
in glowering melancholy on the greasy,
dirt-browned board that did service as
chair and bed to the transitory tenants of
the cell, steps paused in the corridor without and a
key rattled in his door. He rose dully out of his
dejection. A scowling officer admitted a man,
round and short and with side whiskers, and locked
the door upon his back.</p></div>

<p>"This is a pretty how-to-do!" growled the man,
coming forward.</p>

<p>Tom stared at his visitor. "Why, Mr. Driscoll!"
he cried.</p>

<p>"That's who the most of my friends say I am,"
the contractor admitted gruffly.</p>

<p>He deposited himself upon the bench that had
seated and bedded so much unwashed misfortune,
and, his back against the cement wall, turned his
sour face about the bare room. "This is what I call
a pretty poor sort of hospitality to offer a visitor,"
he commented, in his surly voice. "Not even a chair
to sit on."</p>

<p>"There is also the floor; you may take your
choice," Tom returned, nettled by the other's manner.
He himself took the bench.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll stared at him with blinking eyes,
and he stared back defiantly. In Tom's present
mood of wrath and depression his temper was tinder
waiting another man's spark.</p>

<p>"Huh!" Mr. Driscoll ran his pudgy forefinger
easefully about between his collar and his neck, and
removing his spectacles mopped his purple face.
"What's this funny business you've been up to
now?" he asked.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Tom demanded, his irritation
mounting.</p>

<p>"You ought to read the papers and keep posted
on what you do. I just saw a <i>Star</i>. There's half a
page of your face, and about a pint of red ink."</p>

<p>Tom groaned, and his jaws clamped ragefully.</p>

<p>"What I read gave me the impression you'd been
having a sort of private Fourth of July celebration,"
Mr. Driscoll pursued.</p>

<p>Tom turned on the contractor half savagely. "See
here! I don't know what you came here for, but if
it was for this kind of talk&mdash;well, you can guess how
welcome you are!"</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll emitted a little chuckling sound, or
Tom thought for an instant he did. But a glance at
that sour face, with its straight pouting mouth, corrected
Tom's ears.</p>

<p>"Now, what was your fool idea in blowing up
the Avon?"</p>

<p>Tom uprose wrathfully. "Do you mean to say
you believe the lies those blackguards told this morning?"</p>

<p>"I only know what I read in the papers."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span></p>

<p>"If you swallow everything you see in the papers,
you must have an awful maw!"</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose you have got some sort of a story
you put up."</p>

<p>Tom glared at his pudgy visitor who questioned
with such an exasperating presumption. "Did I ask
you here?" he demanded.</p>

<p>The contractor's eyes snapped, and Tom expected
hot words. But none came. "Don't get hot under
the collar," Mr. Driscoll advised, running his comforting
finger under his own. "Come, what's your
side of the story?"</p>

<p>Tom was of half a mind to give a curt refusal. But
his wrong was too great, too burning, for him to keep
silent upon it. He would have talked of it to any
one&mdash;to his very walls. He took a turn in the cell,
then paused before his old employer and hotly
explained his innocence and Foley's guilt.</p>

<p>While Tom spoke Mr. Driscoll's head nodded
excitedly.</p>

<p>"Just what I said!" he cried when Tom ended,
and brought his fist down on his knee. "Well, we'll
show him!"</p>

<p>"Show him what?" Tom asked.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll stopped his fist midway in another
excited descent. He stood up, for he saw the officer's
scowling face at the grated front of the cell.
"Oh, a lot of things before he dies. As for you,
keep your courage up. What else's it for?"</p>

<p>He held out his hand. Tom took it with bewildered
perfunctoriness.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll passed through the door, held open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
by the officer. Outside he turned about and
growled through the bars: "Now don't be blowing
up any more buildings!"</p>

<p>Tom, stung anew, would have retorted in kind,
but Mr. Driscoll's footsteps had died away down the
corridor before adequate words came to him.</p>

<p>It was about an hour later that the officer appeared
before his cell again and unlocked his door.
"Come on," he said shortly.</p>

<p>Tom, supposing he was at length to be removed
to the county jail, put on his hat and stepped outside
the cell. He had expected to find policemen in the
corridor, and to be handcuffed. But the officer was
alone.</p>

<p>Two cells away he saw Jake's malignant face peering
at him through the bars. "I guess this puts us
about even!" Jake called out.</p>

<p>Tom shook his fist. "Wait till the trial! We'll
see!" he cried vengefully.</p>

<p>"Shut up, youse!" shouted the surly watchman.
He pushed Tom through the corridor and up a stairway.
At its head Tom was guided through a door,
and found himself in the general hall of the police
station.</p>

<p>"Here youse are," said the officer, starting for
the sergeant's desk. "Come on and sign the bail
bond."</p>

<p>Tom caught his arm. "What's this mean?" he
cried.</p>

<p>"Don't youse know? Youse're bailed out."</p>

<p>"Bailed out! Who by?"</p>

<p>"Didn't he tell youse?" Surprise showed in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
crabbed face of the officer. "Why, before he done
anything he went down to talk it over with youse."</p>

<p>"Not Mr. Driscoll?"</p>

<p>"I don't know his name. That red-faced old
geezer in the glasses. Huh!&mdash;his coin comes easier'n
mine."</p>

<p>Tom put his name to the bond, already signed by
Mr. Driscoll, and stumbled out into the street, half
blinded by the rush of sunlight into his cell-darkened
eyes, and struck through with bewilderment at his
unexpected liberation. He threw off a number of
quizzing reporters, who had got quick news of his
release, and walked several aimless blocks before he
came back to his senses. Then he set out for Mr.
Driscoll's office, almost choking with emotion at the
prospect of meeting Ruth again. But he reached it
too late to spend his thanks or to test his self-control.
It was past six and the office was locked.</p>

<p>He started home, and during the car ride posted
himself upon his recent doings by reading the accounts
of the trial and his part in the Avon outrage. On
reaching the block in which he lived he hesitated long
before he found the courage to go up to the ordeal
of telling Maggie his last misfortune. When he
entered his flat it was to find it empty. He sat down
at the window, with its backyard view of clothes-lines
and of fire-escape landings that were each an open-air
pantry, and rehearsed the sentences with which he
should break the news to her, his suspense mounting
as the minutes passed. At length her key sounded in
the lock, he heard her footsteps, then saw her dim
shape come into the sitting-room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>In the same instant she saw him at the window.
"What&mdash;Tom!" she cried, with the tremulous relief
of one who ends a great suspense.</p>

<p>He had been nerving himself to face another mood
than this. He was taken aback by the unexpected
note in her voice&mdash;a sympathetic note he had not
heard for such a time it seemed he had never heard it
at all.</p>

<p>He rose, embarrassed. "Yes," he said.</p>

<p>She had come quickly to his side, and now caught
his arm. "You are here, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," he answered, still dazed and at a
loss. "Where have you been, Maggie?"</p>

<p>Had the invading twilight not half blindfolded
him, Tom could have seen the rapid change that took
place in Maggie's face&mdash;the relief at finding him safe
yielding to the stronger emotion beneath it. When
she answered her voice was as of old. "Been?
Where haven't I been? To the jail the last place."</p>

<p>"To the jail?" He was again surprised. "Then
... you know all?"</p>

<p>"Know all?" She laughed harshly, a tremolo
beneath the harshness. "How could I help knowing
all? The newsboys yelling down in the street! The
neighbors coming in with their sympathy!" She did
not tell him how to these visitors she had hotly
defended his innocence.</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were at the police station," he
said weakly, still at a loss.</p>

<p>"Of course not. When I got there they told me
you'd been let out." Her breath was coming rapidly,
deeply. "What a time I had! I didn't know how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
to get to the jail! Dragging myself all over town!
Those awful papers everywhere! Everybody looking
at me and guessing who I was! Oh, the disgrace!
The disgrace!"</p>

<p>"But, Maggie, I didn't do this!"</p>

<p>"The world don't know that!" The rage and
despair that had been held in check all afternoon by
her concern for him now completely mastered her.
"We're disgraced! You've been in jail! You're
now only out on bail! Fifteen thousand dollars bail!
Why that boss, Mr. Driscoll, went on it, heaven only
knows! You're going to be tried. Even if you get
off we'll never hear the last of it. Hadn't we had
trouble enough? Now it's disgrace! And why's this
come on us? You tell me that!"</p>

<p>She was shaking all over, and for her to speak was
a struggle with her sobs. She supported herself with
arms on the table, and looked at him fiercely, wildly,
through the dim light.</p>

<p>Tom took her arm. "Sit down, Maggie," he said,
and tried to push her into a chair.</p>

<p>She repulsed him. "Answer me. Why has this
trouble come on us?"</p>

<p>He was silent.</p>

<p>"Oh, you know! Because you wouldn't take a little
advice from your wife! Other men got along with
Foley and held their jobs. But you wanted to be
different; you wanted to fight Foley. Well, you've
had your way; you've fought him. And what of it?
We're ruined! Disgraced! You're working for less
than half what you used to get. We're ashamed to
show our faces in the street. All because you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
wouldn't pay any attention to me. And me&mdash;how
I've got to suffer for it! Oh, my God! My God!"</p>

<p>Tom recognized the justice, from her point of view,
in her wild phrases and did not try to dispute her. He
again tried to push her into a chair.</p>

<p>She threw off his hand, and went hysterically on,
now beating her knuckles upon the table. "Leave
me alone! I've made up my mind about one thing.
You won't listen to reason. I've given you good
advice. I've been right every time. You've paid no
attention to me and we're ruined! Well, I've made
up my mind. If you do this sort of thing again,
I'll lock you out of the house! D'you hear? I'll lock
you out of the house!"</p>

<p>She fell of her own accord into a chair, and with
her head in her hands abandoned herself to sobbing.
Tom looked at her silently. In a narrow way, she
was right. In a broad way, he knew he was right.
But he could not make her understand, so there was
nothing he could say. Presently he noticed that her
hair had loosened and her hat had fallen over one
cheek. With unaccustomed hands he took out the
pins and laid the hat upon the table. She gave no
sign that she had noted the act.... Her sobs
became fewer and less violent.</p>

<p>Tom quietly lit the gas. "Where's Ferdinand?"
he asked, in his ordinary voice.</p>

<p>"I left him with Mrs. Jones," she answered
through her hands.</p>

<p>When Tom came back with the boy she was in the
kitchen, a big apron over her street dress, beginning
the dinner. Tom looked in upon her, then obeying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
an impulse long unstirred he began to set the table.
She glanced furtively at this unusual service, but said
nothing. She sat through the meal with hard face,
but did not again refer to the day's happenings; and,
since the day was Wednesday, as soon as he had
eaten Tom hurried away to Potomac Hall.</p>

<p>Tom was surrounded by friends the minute he
entered the hall. The ten o'clock edition of the
evening papers, out before seven, had acquainted
them with his release. The accounts in this edition
played up the anomaly of this labor ruffian, shown by
his act to be the arch-enemy of the employers, being
bailed out by one of the very contractors with whom
the union was at war. Two of the papers printed
interviews with Mr. Driscoll upon the question, why
had he done it? One interview was, "I don't
know"; the other, "None of your business."</p>

<p>Tom's friends had the curiosity of the papers, and
put to him the question the news sheets had put to Mr.
Driscoll. "If Mr. Driscoll don't know, how can I?"
was all the answer he could give them. Their curiosity,
however, was weak measured by their indignation
over the turn events had taken in the court-room.
They would stand by him at his trial, they
declared, and show what his relations had been with
Jake, Bill and Arkansas.</p>

<p>Before the meeting was opened there was talk
among the Foleyites against Tom being allowed to
preside, but he ended their muttering by marching to
his table and pounding the union to order. He
immediately took the floor and in a speech filled with
charges against Foley gave to the union his side of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
the facts that had already been presented them from
a different viewpoint in the papers. When he ended
Foley's followers looked to their chief to make reply,
but Foley kept his seat. Connelly, seeing it his duty
to defend his leader, was rising to his feet when a
glance from Foley made him sink back into his chair.
The talk from Tom's side went hotly on for a time,
but, meeting with no resistance, and having no immediate
purpose, it dwindled away.</p>

<p>The union then turned to matters pertaining to the
management of the strike. As the discussion went on
followers of Foley slipped quietly about the hall
whispering in the ears of their brethren. The talk
became tedious. Tom's friends, wearied and uninterested,
sat in silence. Foleyites spoke at great length
upon unimportant details. Foley himself made a
long speech, the like of which had never before come
from him, it was that dull and purposeless. At half-past
ten, by which time the men usually were restless
to be out of the hall and bound toward their beds,
adjournment seemed as far off as at eight. Sleepy
and bored by the stupid discussion, members began to
go out, and most of those that left were followers
of Tom. The pointless talk went on; men kept slipping
out. At twelve o'clock not above two hundred
were in the hall, and of these not two dozen were
Tom's friends.</p>

<p>Tom saw Foley cast his eyes over the thinned
crowd, and then give a short nod at Connelly. The
secretary stood up and claimed Tom's recognition.</p>

<p>"Mr. President, I move we suspend the constitution."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>The motion was instantly seconded. Tom promptly
ruled it out of order, on the ground that it was unconstitutional
to suspend the constitution. But he was
over-ruled, only a score siding with him. The motion
was put and was carried by the same big majority that
had voted against his decision.</p>

<p>Connelly rose a second time. "I make a motion
that we remove the president from office on the charge
that he is the instigator of an outrage that has blackened
the fair name of our union before all the world."</p>

<p>A hundred voices cried a second to the motion.
Tom rose and looked with impotent wrath into the
faces of the crowd from which Foley's cunning had
removed his followers. Then he tossed the gavel
upon the table.</p>

<p>"I refuse to put the motion!" he shouted; and
picking up his hat he strode down the middle aisle.
Half-way to the door he heard Connelly, in the
absence of the vice-president, put the motion; and
turning as he passed out he glimpsed the whole crowd
on its feet.</p>

<p>The next morning Tom saw by his newspaper that
Connelly was the union's new president; also that he
had been dropped from the strike committee, Hogan
now being in his place. The reports in the papers
intimated that the union had partially exonerated
itself by its prompt discardure of the principal in the
Avon explosion. The editorial pages expressed surprise
that the notorious Foley bore no relation to an
outrage that seemed a legitimate offspring of his
character.</p>

<p>Tom had not been at work more than an hour when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
a boy brought him word that the superintendent of
the shipping department desired to see him. He
hurried to his superior's office.</p>

<p>"You were not at work yesterday?" the superintendent
said.</p>

<p>"No," Tom admitted.</p>

<p>The head of the department drew a morning paper
from a pigeon-hole and pointed at a face on its first
page. "Your likeness, I believe."</p>

<p>"It was intended for me."</p>

<p>He touched a button, and a clerk appeared.
"Phillips, make out Keating's time check." He
turned sharply back upon Tom. "That's all. We've
got no use for anarchists in our business."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap_1">When Ruth carried a handful of letters she
had just finished into Mr. Driscoll's office&mdash;this
while he sat talking to Tom in the
latter's cell&mdash;she saw staring luridly at
her from the desk the newspaper that had sent her
employer to the jail on his errand of gruff mercy.
There was a great drawing of Tom's face, brutalized,
yet easily recognizable, and over it the heavy crimson
heading:</p></div>

<table class="ps" style="width: 80%;" summary="heading">
<tr>
<td class="center smaller"><span class="smcap">TOOLS</span><br />

<td class="center smaller"><span class="smcap">FORCED BY</span><br />
<span class="smcap">DEATH THREATS</span></td>
<td class="bigger">BLEW UP THE AVON</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>The stare of that brutal face and of those red
words sent her sinking into Mr. Driscoll's chair, and
the letters fluttered to the floor. After a moment she
reached in eager revulsion for the paper, and her eyes
reeled through the high-colored account of the court
scene. What was printed there was the newest of
news to her; she had lunched early, and the paper she
had bought to learn the latest developments in the
Avon case had carried her only to the beginning of
the trial. As she read, a dizzy sickness ran through
all her body. The case against Tom, as the papers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
made it out, was certainly strong; and the fact that he,
the instigator of the outrage, had attempted to escape
blame by seeking to help convict his own tools was
emphasized as the most blackening phase of the whole
black affair. But strong as the case appeared, within
her sickened, bewildered self there was something that
protested the story could not possibly be true.</p>

<p>During the weeks that had passed since she had
last seen Tom she had wondered much that he had not
come again, guessing every reason but the right one.
When ten days had passed without a visit from him
she had concluded that he must be too busy in the
management of the strike to spare an evening; she
did not know how completely Tom had been crowded
off the stage by Foley. When more days had passed,
and still no call from him, her subtle woman's nature
had supplied another reason, and one that was a sufficient
explanation to her even to the present. She
knew what Tom's feelings were toward her; a woman
needs precious little insight to discover when a man
loves her. For all her instinctive democracy, she was
perfectly conscious of the social difference between
herself and him, and with not unnatural egotism she
endowed Tom with the same consciousness. He loved
her, but felt their social inequality, and felt it with
such keenness that he deemed it hopeless to try to win
her, and so had decided to see her no more.</p>

<p>Such was her explanation of his absence. She pitied
him with a warm romantic pity for his renunciation.
Held away by such a reason, she knew that if ever he
came it must be at her bidding. At times she had
been impelled to send for him to come. To her this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
was not an impulse of prohibitive unmaidenliness; she
could bend to a man who thought himself beneath her
as she never could to a man on her own level. But
she had not sent. To do so without being prepared
to give him what he desired would be to do him a
great wrong, and to give him this she was neither
able nor ready. She admired all that was good in
him; but she could not blind her eyes to his shortcomings,
and to go into his world, with its easily imagined
coarseness, with its ignorance of books and music
and painting, and all the little refinements that were
dear to her, she could not. And yet her heart had
ached that he had not come.</p>

<p>But now as she read the story of his disgrace, and
as the reflux of wits and strength began, all her heart
was one protest of his innocence, and she forgot all
the little differences that had before halted her desire
to see him; and this desire, freed of its checks, suddenly
expanded till it filled the uttermost recesses of
her soul.</p>

<p>Her first impulse, when she had reached the
story's end, was to go straight to him, and she went
so far as to put on her hat. But reason stopped
her at the door. She could do him no good, and her
call would be but an embarrassment to them both. She
removed her hat, and sat down to surging thoughts.</p>

<p>She was sitting at her desk, white and weak, reading
anew the lurid story in the paper, when Mr. Driscoll
passed through her room into his office with hat
drawn over his eyes. She looked through his open
door for several minutes&mdash;and then, obeying the
desire for the relief of speech, she went in.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you see this article about Mr. Keating?"
she asked, trying to keep her personal interest in Tom
from showing in her voice.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll's hat brim was still over his eyes.
He did not look up. "Yes," he said gruffly.</p>

<p>"You remember him, don't you?&mdash;one of the foremen?"</p>

<p>The hat brim moved affirmatively.</p>

<p>She had to summon all her strength to put her next
question with calmness. "What will be done with
him?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. Blowing up buildings isn't a very
innocent amusement."</p>

<p>"But he didn't do it!"</p>

<p>"He didn't? Hum!"</p>

<p>Ruth burned to make a hot defense. But instead
she asked: "Do you think he's the sort of a man to
do a thing of that sort? He says he didn't."</p>

<p>"What d'you suppose he'd say?"</p>

<p>She checked her rising wrath. "But what do you
think will be done with him?"</p>

<p>"Hung," growled Mr. Driscoll.</p>

<p>She glared at him, but his hat brim shielded off
her resentment; and without another word she swept
indignantly out of the room.</p>

<p>Ruth went home in that weakening anxiety which
is most felt by the helpless. On the way she bought
an evening paper, but there was nothing new in it.
After a dinner hardly touched she went into the
street and got a ten o'clock edition. It had the story
of Tom's release on bail.</p>

<p>"Why, the dear old bear!" she gasped, as she dis<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>covered
that Mr. Driscoll had gone Tom's bond. She
hurried to her room and in utter abandonment to her
emotion wrote Tom a note asking him to call the following
evening.</p>

<p>The next morning Tom, discharged but half an
hour before, walked into Ruth's office. He had stood
several minutes in front of the building before he had
gained sufficient control to carry him through the
certain meeting with her. She went red at sight of
him, and rose in a throbbing confusion, but subdued
herself to greet him with a friendly cordiality.</p>

<p>"It's been a long time since I've seen you," she
said, giving him her hand. It was barely touched,
then dropped.</p>

<p>"Yes. I've been&mdash;very&mdash;busy," Tom mumbled,
his big chest heaving. It seemed that his mind, his
will, were slipping away from him. He seized his
only safety. "Is Mr. Driscoll in?"</p>

<p>"Yes." Suddenly chilled, she went into Mr. Driscoll's
room. "He says he's too busy to see you," she
said on her return; and then a little of her greeting
smile came back: "But I think you'd better go in,
anyhow."</p>

<p>As Tom entered Mr. Driscoll looked up with something
that was meant to be a scowl. He had had one
uncomfortable scene already that morning. "Didn't
I say I was busy?" he asked sharply.</p>

<p>"I was told you were. But you didn't think I'd
go away without thanking you?"</p>

<p>"It's a pity a man can't make a fool of himself
without being slobbered over. Well, if you've got to,
out with it! But cut it short."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span></p>

<p>Tom expressed his thanks warmly, and obediently
made them brief. "But I don't know what you did
it for?" he ended.</p>

<p>"About fifty reporters have been asking that same
thing."</p>

<p>The telephone in Ruth's office began to ring. He
waited expectantly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Bobbs wants to speak to you," said Ruth,
appearing at the door.</p>

<p>"Tell him I'm out&mdash;or dead," he ordered, and
went on to Tom: "And he's about the seventeenth
contractor that's asked the same question, and tried
to walk on my face. Maybe because I don't love
Foley. I don't know myself. A man goes out of his
head now and then, I suppose." His eyes snapped
crossly.</p>

<p>"If you're sorry this morning, withdraw the bail
and I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you try to be a fool, too! All I ask of
you is, don't skip town, and don't blow up any more
buildings."</p>

<p>Tom gave his word, smiling into the cross face;
and was withdrawing, when Mr. Driscoll stood up.
"When this strike you started is over come around
to see me." He held out his hand; his grasp was
warm and tight. "Good-by."</p>

<p>Tom, having none of that control and power of
simulation which are given by social training, knew of
but one way to pass safely by the danger beyond Mr.
Driscoll's door. He hurried across Ruth's office
straight for the door opening into the hallway. He
had his hand on the knob, when he felt how brutal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
was his discourtesy. He turned his head. Ruth sat
before the typewriter, her white face on him.</p>

<p>"Good-by," he said.</p>

<p>She did not answer, and he went dazedly out.</p>

<p>Ruth sat in frozen stillness for long after he had
gone. This new bearing of Tom toward her fitted
her explanation for his long absence&mdash;and did not fit
it. If he had renounced her, though loving her, he
probably would have borne himself in the abrupt way
he had just done. And he might have acted in just
this same way had he come to be indifferent to her.
This last was the chilling thought. If he had received
her letter then his abrupt manner could mean only
that this last thought struck the truth. When she had
written him she had been certain of his feeling for her;
that certainty now changed to uncertainty, she would
have given half her life to have called the letter back
with unbroken seal.</p>

<p>She told herself that he would not come,&mdash;told
herself this as she automatically did her work, as she
rode home in the car, as she made weak pretense of
eating dinner. And yet, after dinner, she put on the
white dress that his eyes had told her he liked so well.
And later, when Mr. Berman's card was brought her,
she sent down word that she was ill.</p>

<p>Presently ... he came. He did not speak
when she opened the door to him, nor did she. There
was an unmastering fever burning in his throat and
through all his body; and all her inner self was the
prisoner of a climacteric paralysis. They held hands
for a time, laxly, till one loosed, and then both
swung limply back to their places.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>"I just got your letter to-night&mdash;when I got home,"
he said, driving out the words. But he said nothing
of his struggle: how he had fought back his longing
and determined not to come; and how, the victory
won, he had madly thrown wisdom aside and rushed
to her.</p>

<p>They found seats, somehow, she in a chair, he on
the green couch, and sat in a silence their heart-beats
seemed to make sonant. She was the first to recover
somewhat, and being society bred and so knowing the
necessity of speech, she questioned him about his
arrest.</p>

<p>He started out on the story haltingly. But little
by little his fever lost its invalidating control, and
little by little the madness in his blood, the madness
that had forced him hither, possessed his brain
and tongue, and the words came rapidly, with spirit.
Finishing the story of his yesterday he harked back
to the time he had last seen her, and told her what
had happened in the second part of that evening in
the hall over the Third Avenue saloon; told her how
Foley had stolen the strike; how he had declined to
his present insignificance. And as he talked he eagerly
drank in her sympathy, and loosed himself more and
more to the enjoyment of the mad pleasure of being
with her. To her his words were not the account of
the more or less sordid experiences of a workingman;
they were the story of the reverses of the hero
who, undaunted, has given battle to one whom all
others have dared not, or cared not, fight.</p>

<p>"What will you do now?" she asked when he had
ended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know. Foley says he has me down and
out&mdash;if you know what that means."</p>

<p>She nodded.</p>

<p>"I guess he's about right. Not many people want
to hire men who blow up buildings. I had thought
I'd work at whatever I could till October&mdash;our next
election's then&mdash;and run against Foley again. But if
he wins the strike he may be too strong to beat."</p>

<p>"But do you think he'll win the strike?"</p>

<p>"He'll be certain to win, though this explosion will
injure us a lot. He's in for the strike for all he's
worth, and when he fights his best he's hard to beat.
The bosses can't get enough iron-men to keep their
jobs going. That's already been proved. And in a
little while all the other trades will catch up to where
we left off; they'll have to stop then, for they can't
do anything till our work's been done. That'll be
equivalent to a general strike in all the building trades.
We'll be losing money, of course, but so'll the bosses.
The side'll win that can hold out longest, and we're
fixed to hold out."</p>

<p>"According to all the talk I hear the victory is
bound to go the opposite way."</p>

<p>"Well, you know some people then who'll be
mighty disappointed!" Tom returned.</p>

<p>She did not take him up, and silence fell between
them. Thus far their talk had been of the facts of
their daily lives, and though it had been unnatural
in that it was far from the matter in both their hearts,
yet by help of its moderate distraction they had managed
to keep their feelings under control. But now,
that distraction ended, Tom's fever began to burn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
back upon him. He sat rigidly upright, his eyes
avoiding her face, and the fever flamed higher and
higher. Ruth gazed whitely at him, hands gripped
in her lap, her faculties slipping from her, waiting she
hardly knew what. Minutes passed, and the silence
between them grew intenser and more intense.</p>

<p>Amid her throbbing dizziness Ruth's mind held
steadily to just two thoughts: she was again certain
of Tom's love, and certain that his pride would never
allow him to speak. These two thoughts pointed her
the one thing there was for her to do; the one thing
that must be done for both their sakes&mdash;and finally
she forced herself to say: "It has been a long time
since you have been to see me. I had thought you
had quite forgotten me."</p>

<p>"I have thought of you often?" he managed to
return, eyes still fixed above her, his self-control tottering.</p>

<p>"But in a friendly way?&mdash;No.&mdash;Or you would
not have been silent through two months."</p>

<p>His eyes came down and fastened upon that noble
face, and the words escaped by the guard he tried to
keep at his lips: "I have never had a friend like
you."</p>

<p>She waited.</p>

<p>"You are my best friend," the words continued.</p>

<p>She waited again, but he said nothing more.</p>

<p>She drove herself on. "And yet you could&mdash;stay
away two months?&mdash;till I sent for you?"</p>

<p>He stood up, and walked to the window and stood
as if looking through it&mdash;though the shade was
drawn. She saw the fingers at his back writhing and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
knotting themselves. She waited, unwinking, hardly
breathing, all her life in the tumultuous beating of
her heart.</p>

<p>He turned about. His face was almost wild. "I
stayed away&mdash;because I love you&mdash;&mdash;" His last
word was a gasp, and he did not have the strength to
say the rest.</p>

<p>It had come! Her great strain over, she fairly collapsed
in a swooning happiness. Her head drooped,
and she swayed forward till her elbows were on her
knees. For a moment she existed only in her great,
vague, reeling joy. Then she heard a spasmodic
gasp, and heard his hoarse words add:</p>

<p>"And because&mdash;I am married."</p>

<p>Her head uprose slowly, and she looked at him,
looked at him, with a deadly stupefaction in her eyes.
A sickening minute passed. "Married?" she
whispered.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;married."</p>

<p>A terrified pallor overspread her face, but the face
held fixedly to his own. He stood rigid, looking at
her. Her strange silence began to alarm him.</p>

<p>"What is it?" he cried.</p>

<p>Her face did not change, and seconds passed.
Suddenly a gasp, then a little groan, broke from her.</p>

<p>"Married!" she cried.</p>

<p>For a moment he was astounded; then he began
dimly to understand. "What, you don't mean&mdash;&mdash;"
he commenced, with dry lips. He moved, with
uncertain steps, up before her. "You don't&mdash;care
for me?"</p>

<p>The head bowed a trifle.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" He half staggered backward
into a chair, and his face fell into his hands. He saw,
in an agonizing vision, what might have been his, and
what never could be his; and he saw the wide desert
of his future.</p>

<p>"You!" He heard her voice, and he looked up.</p>

<p>She was on her feet, and was standing directly in
front of him. Her hands were clenched upon folds
of her skirt. Her breath was coming rapidly. Her
eyes were flashing.</p>

<p>"You! How could you come to see me as you
have, and you married?" She spoke tremulously,
fiercely, and at the last her voice broke into a sob.
Tears ran down her cheeks, but she did not heed them.</p>

<p>Tom's face dropped back into his hands; he could
not stand the awful accusation of that gaze. She was
another victim of his tragedy, an innocent victim&mdash;and
<i>his</i> victim. He saw in a flash the whole ghastly
part he, in ignorance, had played. A groan burst
from his lips, and he writhed in his self-abasement.</p>

<p>"How could you do it?" he heard her fiercely
demand again. "Oh, you! you!" He heard her
sweep across the little room, and then sweep back;
and he knew she was standing before him, gazing
down at him in anguish, anger, contempt.</p>

<p>He groaned again. "What can I say to you&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>There was silence. He could feel her eyes, unchanging,
still on him. Presently he began to speak
into his hands, in a low, broken voice. "I can make
no excuse. I don't know that I can explain. But
I never intended to do this. Never! Never!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know how we met, how we came to be
together the first two or three times. Afterwards
... I said awhile ago that you were my best friend.
I have had few real friends&mdash;none but you who sympathized
with me, who seemed to understand me.
Well, afterwards I came because&mdash;I never stopped to
think why I came. I guess because you understood,
and I liked you. And so I came. As a man might
come to see a good man friend. And I never once
thought I was doing wrong. And I never thought of
my wife&mdash;that is, you understand, that she made it
wrong for me to see you. I never thought&mdash;&mdash;If
you believe in me at all, you must believe this. You
must! And then&mdash;one day&mdash;I saw you with another
man, and I knew I loved you. I awoke. I saw what
I ought to do. I tried to do it&mdash;but it was very hard&mdash;and
I came to see you again&mdash;the last time. I said
once more I would not see you again. It was still
hard, very hard&mdash;but I did not. And then&mdash;your
letter&mdash;came&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>His words dwindled away. Then, after a moment,
he said very humbly: "Perhaps I don't just understand
how to be a gentleman."</p>

<p>Again silence. Presently he felt a light touch on
his shoulder. He raised his eyes. She was still gazing
at him, her face very white, but no anger in it.</p>

<p>"I understand," she said.</p>

<p>He rose&mdash;weak. "I can't ask that you forgive
me."</p>

<p>"No. Not now."</p>

<p>"Of course. I have meant to you only grief&mdash;pain.
And can mean only that to you, always."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>

<p>She did not deny his words.</p>

<p>"Of course," he agreed. Then he stood, without
words, unmoving.</p>

<p>"You had better go," she said at length.</p>

<p>He took his hat mechanically. "The future?"</p>

<p>"You were right."</p>

<p>"You mean&mdash;we should not meet again?"</p>

<p>"This is the last time."</p>

<p>Again he stood silent, unmoving.</p>

<p>"You had better go," she said. "Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night."</p>

<p>He moved sideways to the door, his eyes never
leaving her. He paused. She stood just as she had
since she had touched his shoulder. He moved back
to her, as in a trance.</p>

<p>"No." She held up a hand, as if to ward him off.</p>

<p>He took the hand&mdash;and the other hand. They
were all a-tremble. And he bent down, slowly,
toward her face that he saw as in a mist. The face
did not recede. Their cold lips met. At the touch
she collapsed, and the next instant she was sobbing
convulsively in his arms.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>And all that night she lay dressed on her couch....
And all that night he walked the streets.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE PROGRESS OF THE STRIKE</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idcw.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="W" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">When morning began to creep into the
streets, and while it was yet only a dingy
mist, Tom slipped quietly into his flat and
stretched his wearied length upon the
couch, his anguish subdued to an aching numbness by
his lone walk. He lay for a time, his eyes turned
dully into the back yard, watching the dirty light grow
cleaner; and presently he sank into a light sleep. After
a little his eyes opened and he saw Maggie looking
intently at him from their bedroom door.</p></div>

<p>For a moment the two of them maintained a silent
gaze. Then she asked: "You were out all night?"</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered passively.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>He hesitated. "I was walking about&mdash;thinking."</p>

<p>"I should think you would be thinking! After
what happened to you Wednesday, and after losing
your job yesterday!"</p>

<p>He did not correct her misinterpretation of his
answer, and as he said nothing more she turned back
into the bedroom, and soon emerged dressed. As
she moved about preparing breakfast his eyes rested
on her now and then, and in a not unnatural selfishness
he dully wondered why they two were married.
Her feeling for him, he knew, was of no higher sort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
than that attachment which dependence upon a man
and the sense of being linked to him for life may
engender in an unspiritual woman. There was no
love between them; they had no ideas in common; she
was not this, and not this, and not this. And all the
things that she was not, the other was. And it was
always to be Maggie that he was to see thus intimately.</p>

<p>He had bowed to the situation as the ancients
bowed to fate&mdash;accepted it as a fact as unchangeable
as death that has fallen. And yet, as he lay watching
her, thinking it was to be always so,&mdash;always!&mdash;his
soul was filled with agonizing rebellion; and so it was
to be through many a day to come. But later, as his
first pain began to settle into an aching sense of irreparable
loss, his less selfish vision showed him that
Maggie was no more to blame for their terrible mistake
than he, and not so much; and that she, in a less
painful degree, was also a pitiable victim of their
error. He became consciously considerate of her.
For her part, she at first marveled at this gentler
manner, then slowly yielded to it.</p>

<p>But this is running ahead. The first days were all
the harder to Tom because he had no work to share
his time with his pain. He did not seek another position;
as he had told Ruth, he knew it would be useless
to ask for work so long as the charge of being a
dynamiter rested upon him. He walked about the
streets, trying to forget his pain in mixing among his
old friends, with no better financial hope than to
wait till the court had cleared his name. Several times
he met Pig Iron Pete, who, knowing only the public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
cause for Tom's dejection, prescribed a few drinks
as the best cure for such sorrow, and showed his faith
in his remedy by offering to take the same medicine.
And one evening he brought his cheerless presence to
the Barrys'. "Poor fellow!" sighed Mrs. Barry
after he had gone. "He takes his thumps hard."</p>

<p>One day as he walked about the streets he met
Petersen, and with the Swede was a stocky, red-faced,
red-necked man wearing a red necktie whose brilliance
came to a focus in a great diamond pin. Petersen
had continued to call frequently after nightly attendance
had become unnecessary. Two weeks before
Tom had gleaned from him by hard questioning that
the monthly rent of twelve dollars was overdue, the
landlord was raging, there was nothing with which
to pay, and also nothing in the house to eat. The
next day Tom had drawn fifteen dollars from his little
bank account, and held it by him to give to Petersen
when he next called. But he had not come again.
Now on seeing him Tom's first feeling was of guilt
that he had not carried the needed money to Petersen's
home.</p>

<p>The stocky man, when he saw the two were
friends, withdrew himself to the curb and began to
clean his nails with his pocket knife. "How are
you, Petersen?" Tom asked.</p>

<p>"I'm purty good," Petersen returned, glancing
restlessly at the stocky man.</p>

<p>"You don't need a little money, do you?" Tom
queried anxiously.</p>

<p>"No. I'm vorkin'." He again looked restlessly
at his manicuring friend.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't say! That's good. What at?"</p>

<p>Petersen's restlessness became painful. "At de
docks."</p>

<p>Tom saw plainly that Petersen was anxious to get
away, so he said good-by and walked on, puzzled by
the Swede's strange manner, by his rather unusual
companion, and puzzled also as to how his work as
longshoreman permitted him to roam the streets in
the middle of the afternoon.</p>

<p>When Tom met friends in his restless wanderings
and stopped to talk to them, the subject was usually
the injustice he had suffered or the situation regarding
the strike. Up to the day of the Avon explosion the
union as a whole had been satisfied with the strike's
progress. That event, of course, had weakened the
strikers' cause before the public. But the promptness
with which the union was credited to have renounced
the instigator of the outrage partially restored the
ironworkers to their position. They were completely
restored three days after the explosion, when
Mr. Baxter, smarting under his recent loss and not
being able to retaliate directly upon Foley, permitted
himself to be induced by a newspaper to express his
sentiments upon labor unions. The interview was an
elaboration of the views which are already partly
known to the reader. By reason of the rights which
naturally belong to property, he said, by reason of
capital's greatly superior intelligence, it was the privilege
of capital, nay even its duty, to arrange the uttermost
detail of its affairs without any consultation
whatever with labor, whose views were always selfish
and necessarily always unintelligent. The high as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>sumption
of superiority in Mr. Baxter's interview, its
paternalistic, even monarchical, character, did not
appeal to his more democratic and less capitalized
readers, and they drew nearer in sympathy to the men
he was fighting.</p>

<p>As the last days of May passed one by one, Tom's
predictions to Ruth began to have their fulfillment.
By the first of June a great part of the building in the
city was practically at a standstill; the other building
trades had caught up with the ironworkers on many
of the jobs, and so had to lay down their tools. The
contractors in these trades were all checked more or
less in their work. Their daily loss quickly overcame
their natural sympathy with the iron contractors and
Mr. Baxter was beset by them. "We haven't any
trouble with our men," ran the gist of their complaint.
"Why should we be losing money just because you
and your men can't agree? For God's sake, settle it
up so we can get to work!"</p>

<p>Owners of buildings in process of construction, with
big sums tied up in them, began to grow frantic. Their
agreements with the contractors placed upon the latter
a heavy fine for every day the completion of the buildings
was delayed beyond the specified time; but the
contracts contained a "strike clause" which exempted
the bosses from penalties for delays caused by strikes.
And so the loss incurred by the present delay fell
solely upon the owners. "Settle this up somehow,"
they were constantly demanding of Mr. Baxter.
"You've delayed my building a month. There's a
month's interest on my money, and my natural profits
for a month, both gone to blazes!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span></p>

<p>To all of these Mr. Baxter's answer was in substance
the same: "The day the union gives up, on
that day the strike is settled." And this he said with
unchangeable resolution showing through his voice.
The bosses and owners went away cursing and looking
hopelessly upon an immediate future whose only
view to them was a desert of loss.</p>

<p>But Mr. Baxter did not have in his heart the same
steely decision he had in his manner. Events had not
taken just the course he had foreseen. The division
in the union, on which he had counted for its fall, had
been mended by the subsidence of Tom. The union's
resources were almost exhausted, true, but it was
receiving some financial assistance from its national
organization, and its fighting spirit was as strong as
ever. If the aid of the national organization continued
to be given, and if the spirit of the men
remained high, Mr. Baxter realized that the union
could hold out indefinitely. The attempt to replace
the strikers by non-union men had been a failure; Mr.
Driscoll and himself were the only contractors who
still maintained the expensive farce of keeping a few
scabs at work. And despite his surface indifference
to it, the pressure of the owners of buildings and of
the bosses in other trades had a little effect upon Mr.
Baxter, and more than a little upon some other members
of the Executive Committee. A few of the
employers were already eager to yield to the strikers'
demand, preferring decreased profits to a long period
of none at all; but when Mr. Isaacs attempted to
voice the sentiments of these gentlemen in a meeting
of the Executive Committee, a look from Mr. Bax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>ter's
steady gray eyes was enough to close him up
disconcerted.</p>

<p>So Buck Foley was not without a foundation in fact
for his hopeful words when he said in his report to
the union at the first meeting in June: "The only
way we can lose this strike, boys, is to give it away."</p>

<p>Which remark might be said, by one speaking from
the vantage of later events, to have been a bit of
unconscious prophecy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE TRIUMPH OF BUSINESS SENSE</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idcm.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="M" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">Mr. Baxter had to withstand pressure
from still another source&mdash;from himself.
His business sense, as had owners and
contractors, demanded of him an immediate
settlement of the strike. In its frequent debates
with him it was its habit to argue by repeating the
list of evils begotten by the strike, placing its emphasis
on his losses that promised to continue for
months to come. Unlike most reformers and other
critics of the <i>status quo</i>, Mr. Baxter's business sense
was not merely destructive; it offered a practicable
plan for betterment&mdash;a plan that guaranteed victory
over the strikers and required only the sacrifice of
his pride.</p></div>

<p>But Mr. Baxter's pride refused to be sacrificed.
His business sense had suggested the plan shortly
after the union had voted to strike. He would have
adopted the plan immediately, as the obvious procedure
in the situation, had it not been for the break
with Foley. But the break had come, and his pride
could not forget that last visit of Foley to his private
office; it had demanded that the walking delegate
be humiliated&mdash;utterly crushed. His business sense,
from the other side, had argued the folly of allowing
mere emotion to stand in the way of victory and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
profitable resumption of work. Outraged pride had
been the stronger during April and May, but as the
possibility of its satisfaction had grown less and less
as May had dragged by, the pressure of his business
sense had become greater and greater. And the
Avon explosion had given business sense a further
chance to greaten. "Try the plan at once," it had
exhorted; "if you don't, Foley may do it again."
However, for all the pressure of owners and contractors
and of his business sense&mdash;owners and
contractors urging any sort of settlement, so that it
be a settlement, business sense urging its own private
plan&mdash;in the early days of June Mr. Baxter continued
to present the same appearance of wall-like
firmness. But his firmness was that of a dam that
can sustain a pressure of one hundred, and is bearing
a pressure of ninety-nine with its habitual show of
eternal fixedness.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter had to withstand pressure from yet
another source&mdash;from his wife. When he had told
her in early May that the strike was not going to
be settled as quickly as he had first thought, and had
asked her to practice such temporary economy as
she could, she had acquiesced graciously but with
an aching heart; and instead of going to Europe as
she had intended, she and her daughter had run up
to Tuxedo, where with two maids, carriage, and
coachman, they were managing to make both ends
meet on three hundred dollars a week. But when the
first days of June had come, and no prospect of
settlement, she began to think with swelling anxiety
of the Newport season.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why can't this thing be settled right off?" she
said to her husband who had run up Friday evening&mdash;the
Friday after the Wednesday Foley had assured
the union of certain victory&mdash;to stay with her over
Saturday and Sunday. And she acquainted him
with her besetting fears.</p>

<p>Only another unit of pressure was needed to overturn
the wall of Mr. Baxter's resistance, and the
stress of his wife's words was many times the force
required. During his two days at Tuxedo Mr.
Baxter sat much of the time apart in quiet thought.
Mrs. Baxter was too considerate a wife to repeat to
him her anxieties, or to harass him with pleas and
questions, but just before he left early Monday morning
for the city she could not refrain from saying:
"You will try, won't you, dear, to end the strike
soon?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear."</p>

<p>She beamed upon him. "How soon?"</p>

<p>"It will last about three more weeks."</p>

<p>She fell on his neck with a happy cry, and kissed
him. She asked him to explain, but his business
sense had told him it would be better if she did not
know the plan, and his love had given him the same
counsel; so he merely answered, "I am certain the
union will give up," and plead his haste to catch
his train as excuse for saying nothing more.</p>

<p>That afternoon a regular meeting of the Executive
Committee took place in Mr. Baxter's office. It
was not a very cheerful quintet that sat about the
cherry table: Isaacs, in his heart ready to abandon
the fight; Bobbs, Murphy, and Driscoll, determined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
to win, but with no more speedy plan than to continue
the siege; and Baxter, cold and polite as usual,
and about as inspiring as a frozen thought.</p>

<p>There was nothing in the early part of the meeting
to put enthusiasm into the committee. First of all,
Mr. Baxter read a letter from the Civic Federation,
asking the committee if it would be willing to meet
again, in the interest of a settlement, with the
strikers' committee.</p>

<p>"Why not?" said Isaacs, trying to subdue his
eagerness to a business-like calm. "We've got
nothing to lose by it."</p>

<p>"And nothing to gain!" snorted Driscoll.</p>

<p>"Tell the Civic Federation, not on its life," advised
Murphy. "And tell 'em to cut their letters
out. We're gettin' tired o' their eternal buttin' in."</p>

<p>Baxter gave Murphy a chilly glance. "We'll
consider that settled then," he said quietly. In his
own mind, however, he had assigned the offer of the
Civic Federation to a definite use.</p>

<p>There were several routine reports on the condition
of the strike; and the members of the committee
had a chance to propose new plans. Baxter was not
ready to offer his&mdash;he hung back from broaching
it; and the others had none. "Nothin' to do but
set still and starve 'em out," said Murphy, and no
one contradicted him.</p>

<p>At the previous meeting, when pride was still
regnant within him, Mr. Baxter had announced that
he had put detectives on the Avon case with the hope
of gaining evidence that would convict Foley of
complicity in the explosion. Since then the detec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>tives
had reported that though morally certain of
Foley's direct responsibility they could find not one
bit of legal evidence against him. Furthermore,
business sense had whispered Mr. Baxter that it
would be better to let the matter drop, for if
brought to trial Foley might, in a fit of recklessness,
make some undesirable disclosures. So, for his own
reasons, Mr. Baxter had thus far guarded the Avon
explosion from the committee's talk. But at
length Mr. Driscoll, restless at the dead subjects they
were discussing, avoided his guard and asked: "Anything
new in the Avon business?"</p>

<p>"Nothing. My detectives have failed to find
any proof at all of Mr. Foley's guilt."</p>

<p>"Arrest him anyhow," said Driscoll. "If we
can convict him, why the back of the strike's broken."</p>

<p>"There's no use arresting a man unless you can
convict him."</p>

<p>"Take the risk! You're losing your nerve,
Baxter."</p>

<p>Baxter flushed the least trifle at Driscoll's words,
but he did not retort. His eyes ran over the faces
of the four with barely perceptible hesitancy. He
felt this to be his opening, but the plan of his business
sense was a subject difficult and delicate to
handle.</p>

<p>"I have a better use for Mr. Foley," he said
steadily.</p>

<p>"Yes?" cried the others, and leaned toward him.
When Baxter said this much, they knew he had a
vast deal more to say.</p>

<p>"If we could convict him I'd be in favor of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
arrest. But if we try, we'll fail; and that will be
a triumph for the union. So to arrest him is bad
policy."</p>

<p>"Go on," said Murphy.</p>

<p>"Whatever we may say to the public, we know
among ourselves this strike is nowhere near its end.
It may last all summer&mdash;the entire building season."</p>

<p>The four men nodded.</p>

<p>Baxter now spoke with apparent effort. "Why
not make use of Foley and win it in three weeks?"</p>

<p>"How?" asked Driscoll suspiciously.</p>

<p>"How?" asked the others eagerly.</p>

<p>"I suppose most of you have been held up by
Foley?"</p>

<p>There were four affirmative answers.</p>

<p>"You know he's for sale?"</p>

<p>"I've been forced to buy him!" said Driscoll.</p>

<p>Baxter went on more easily, and with the smoothness
of a book. "We have all found ourselves, I
suppose, compelled to take measures in the interests
of peace or the uninterrupted continuance of business
that were repugnant to us. What I am going to
suggest is a thing I would rather not have to do;
but we are face to face with two evils, and this is
the lesser.</p>

<p>"You will bear me out, of course, when I say
the demands of the union are without the bounds of
reason. We can't afford to grant the demands;
and yet the fight against the union may use up the
whole building season. We'll lose a year's profits,
and the men will lose a year's wages, and in the end
we'll win. Since we are certain to win, anyhow, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
seems to me that any plan that will enable us to win
at once, and save our profits and the men's wages,
is justifiable."</p>

<p>"Of course," said three of the men.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Driscoll asked guardedly.</p>

<p>"Many a rebellion has been quelled by satisfying
the leader."</p>

<p>"Oh, come right out with what you mean,"
demanded Driscoll.</p>

<p>"The quickest way of settling the strike, and the
cheapest, for both us and the union, is to&mdash;well, see
that Foley is satisfied."</p>

<p>Driscoll sprang to his feet, his chair tumbling on
its back, and his fist came down upon the table. "I
thought you were driving at that! By God, I'm
getting sick of this whole dirty underhand way of
doing business. I'd get out if I had a half-way
decent offer. The union is in the wrong. Of
course it is! But I want to fight 'em on the square&mdash;in
the open. I don't want to win by bribing a
traitor!"</p>

<p>"It's a case where it would be wrong not to bribe&mdash;if
you want to use so harsh a word," said Baxter,
his face tinged the least bit with red. "It is either
to satisfy Mr. Foley or to lose a summer's work and
have the men and their families suffer from the loss
of a summer's wages. It's a choice between evils.
I'll leave to the gentlemen here, which is the greater."</p>

<p>"Oh, give your conscience a snooze, Driscoll!"
growled Murphy.</p>

<p>"I think Baxter's reasoning is good," said Bobbs.
Isaacs corroborated him with a nod.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's smooth reasoning, but it's rotten!&mdash;as rotten
as hell!" He glared about on the four men. "Are
you all in for Baxter's plan?"</p>

<p>"We haven't heard it all yet," said Bobbs.</p>

<p>"You've heard enough to guess the rest," snorted
Driscoll.</p>

<p>"I think it's worth tryin'," said Murphy.</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said Bobbs.</p>

<p>"We can do no less than that," said Isaacs.</p>

<p>"Then you'll try it without me!" Driscoll
shouted. "I resign from this committee, and resign
quick!"</p>

<p>He grabbed his hat from Baxter's desk and
stamped toward the door. Mr. Baxter's smooth
voice stopped him as his hand was on the knob.</p>

<p>"Even if you do withdraw, of course you'll keep
secret what we have proposed."</p>

<p>Driscoll gulped for a moment before he could
speak; his face deepened its purplish red, and his
eyes snapped and snapped. "Damn you, Baxter,
what sort d'you think I am!" he exploded. "Of
course!"</p>

<p>He opened the door, there was a furious slam, and
he was gone.</p>

<p>The four men looked at each other questioningly.
Baxter broke the silence. "A good fellow," he
said with a touch of pity. "But his ideas are too
inelastic for the business world."</p>

<p>"He ought to be runnin' a girls' boardin' school,"
commented Murphy.</p>

<p>"Perhaps it's just as well he withdrew," said
Baxter. "I take it we're pretty much of one mind."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<p>"Anything to settle the strike&mdash;that's me," said
Murphy. "Come on now, Baxter; give us the
whole plan. Just handin' a roll over to Foley ain't
goin' to settle it. That'd do if it was his strike.
But it ain't. It's the union's&mdash;about three thousand
men. How are you goin' to bring the union
around?"</p>

<p>"The money brings Foley around; Foley brings
the union around. It's very simple."</p>

<p>"As simple as two and two makes seven," growled
Murphy. "Give us the whole thing."</p>

<p>Baxter outlined his entire plan, as he expected it
to work out.</p>

<p>"That sounds good," said Bobbs. "But are you
certain we can buy Foley off?"</p>

<p>"Sure thing," replied Murphy, answering for
Baxter. "If we offer him enough."</p>

<p>"How much do you think it'll take?" asked
Isaacs.</p>

<p>Baxter named a figure.</p>

<p>"So much as that!" cried Isaacs.</p>

<p>"That isn't very much, coming from the Association,"
said Baxter. "You're losing as much in a
week as your assessment would come to."</p>

<p>"I suppose you want the whole Association to
know all about this," remarked Murphy.</p>

<p>"Only we four are to know anything."</p>

<p>"How'll you get the Association to give you the
money then?" Murphy followed up.</p>

<p>"I can get the emergency fund increased. We
have to give no account of that, you know."</p>

<p>"You seem to have thought o' everything, Bax<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>ter,"
Murphy admitted. "I say we can't see Foley
any too soon."</p>

<p>Bobbs and Isaacs approved this judgment
heartily.</p>

<p>"I'll write him, then, to meet us here to-morrow
afternoon. There's one more point now." He
paused to hunt for a phrase. "Don't you think the
suggestion should&mdash;ah&mdash;come from him?"</p>

<p>The three men looked puzzled. "My mind
don't make the jump," said Murphy.</p>

<p>Baxter coughed. It was not very agreeable, this
having to say things right out. "Don't you see?
If we make the offer, it's&mdash;well, it's bribery. But if
we can open the way a little bit, and lead him on to
make the demand, why we're&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Held up, o' course!" supplied Murphy admiringly.</p>

<p>"Yes. In that case, if the negotiations with Foley
come to nothing, or there is a break later, Foley can't
make capital out of it, as he might in the first case.
We're safe."</p>

<p>"We couldn't help ourselves! We were held up!"
Alderman Murphy could not restrain a joyous laugh,
and he held out a red hairy hand. "Put 'er there,
Baxter! There was a time when I classed you with
the rest o' the reform bunch you stand with in politics&mdash;fit
for nothin' but to wear white kid gloves and to
tell people how good you are. But say, you're the
smoothest article I've met yet!"</p>

<p>Baxter, with hardly concealed reluctance, placed his
soft slender hand in Murphy's oily paw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p class="cap_1">It had been hard for Baxter to broach his
plan to the Executive Committee. The
next step in the plan was far harder&mdash;to
write the letter to Foley. His revolted
pride upreared itself against this act, but his business
sense forced him to go on with what he had begun.
So he wrote the letter&mdash;not an easy task of itself,
since the letter had to be so vague as to tell Foley
nothing, and yet so luring as to secure his presence&mdash;and
sent it to Foley's house by messenger.</p></div>

<p>The next afternoon at a quarter past two the committee
was again in Baxter's office. Foley had been
asked to come at half-past. The fifteen minutes
before his expected arrival they spent in rehearsing
the plan, so soon to be put to its severest test.</p>

<p>"I suppose you'll do all the talking, Baxter," said
Bobbs.</p>

<p>"Sure," answered Murphy. "It's his game. I
don't like to give in that any man's better than me,
but when it comes to fine work o' this kind we ain't
one, two, three with Baxter."</p>

<p>Baxter took the compliment with unchanged face.</p>

<p>Foley was not on time. At two-forty he had not
come, and that he would come at all began to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
doubted. At two-fifty he had not arrived. At three
none of the four really expected him.</p>

<p>"Let's go," said Murphy. "He'd 'a' been here
on time if he was comin' at all. I ain't goin' to waste
my time waitin' on any walkin' delegate."</p>

<p>"Perhaps there has been some mistake&mdash;perhaps
he didn't get the letter," suggested Baxter. But his
explanation did not satisfy himself; he had a growing
fear that he had humiliated himself in vain, that
Foley had got the letter and was laughing at him&mdash;a
new humiliation greater even than the first. "But
let's wait a few minutes longer; he may come yet,"
he went on; and after a little persuasion the three
consented to remain half an hour longer.</p>

<p>At quarter past three the office boy brought word
that Foley was without. Baxter ordered that he be
sent in, but before the boy could turn Foley walked
through the open door, derby hat down over his eyes,
hands in his trousers pockets. Baxter stood up, and
the other three rose slowly after him.</p>

<p>"Good-afternoon, gents," Foley said carelessly,
his eyes running rapidly from face to face. "D'I
keep youse waitin'?"</p>

<p>"Only about an hour," growled Murphy.</p>

<p>"Is that so, now? Sorry. I always take a nap
after lunch, an' I overslep' myself."</p>

<p>Foley's eyes had fixed upon Baxter's, and Baxter's
returned their gaze. For several seconds the two
stood looking at each other with expressionless faces,
till the other three began to wonder. Then Baxter
seemed to swallow something. "Won't you please
be seated, Mr. Foley," he said.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure," said Foley in his first careless tone.</p>

<p>The five sat down. Foley again coolly scanned the
committee. "Well?" he said.</p>

<p>The three looked at Baxter to open the conversation.
He did not at once begin, and Foley took out
his watch. "I can only give youse a few minutes,
gents. I've got an engagement up town at four. So
if there's anything doin', s'pose we don't waste no
time in silent prayer."</p>

<p>"We want to talk over the strike with you," began
Baxter.</p>

<p>"Really. If I'd known that now I'd 'a' brought
the committee along."</p>

<p>Murphy scowled at this naïveté. "We don't
want to talk to your committee."</p>

<p>"I'm nobody without the committee. The committee's
runnin' the strike."</p>

<p>"We merely desire to talk things over in a general
way with you in your capacity as an individual,"
said Baxter quickly, to head off other remarks from
Murphy.</p>

<p>"A general talk? Huh! Youse talk two hours;
result&mdash;youse've talked two hours." He slowly rose
and took his hat, covering a yawn with a bony hand.
"Interestin'. I'd like it if I had the time to spare.
But I ain't. Well&mdash;so-long."</p>

<p>"Hold on!" cried Baxter hastily. Foley turned.
"We thought that possibly, as the result of our talk,
we might be able to reach some compromise for the
settlement of the strike."</p>

<p>"If youse've got any plans, that's different."
Foley resumed his chair, resting an elbow on the table.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"But remember I've got another engagement, an'
cut 'em short."</p>

<p>There were five chairs in the room. Baxter had
placed his own with its back to the window, and
Foley's so that the full light fell straight in the walking
delegate's face. His own face, in the shadow,
was as though masked.</p>

<p>Baxter had now immediately before him the task
of opening the way for Foley to make the desired
demand. "This strike has been going on over five
weeks now," he began, watching the walking delegate's
face for any expression significant that his
words were having their effect. "You have been
fixed in your position; we have been fixed in ours.
Your union has lost about three hundred and fifty
thousand dollars. I won't say how much we've lost.
We both seem to be as firmly fixed in our determination
as ever. The strike may last all summer. The
question is, do we both want to keep on losing money&mdash;indefinitely?"</p>

<p>Foley did not take the opening. "That's the
question," he said blandly.</p>

<p>It was a few seconds before Baxter went on. "I
judge that we do not. You have&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Excuse me," said Foley, rising, "but I got weak
eyes, an' this light hurts 'em. Suppose me an' youse
changes chairs." He calmly stepped over to Baxter's
side and waited.</p>

<p>There was nothing for Baxter but to yield the
seat, which he did. Foley sat down, tilted back
against the window sill, and hooked his heels over a
chair rung.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your union has perhaps a million dollars at
stake," Baxter continued at the same even pitch.
"We have&mdash;a great deal, and the owners stand to
lose heavily. If by talking an hour we can devise a
plan by which this can be saved, it's worth while, is
it not?"</p>

<p>"Sure. Speakin' as an individual, I'm willin' to
talk twice as long for half as much," Foley drawled.</p>

<p>There was a silence. The three men, their elbows
on the polished table, looked on as though spectators
at a play.</p>

<p>"I wonder if you have anything to propose?"
asked Baxter guardedly.</p>

<p>"Me? I come to use my ears, not my tongue."</p>

<p>The two men watched each other narrowly. The
advantage, if there could be advantage in the case of
two faces under perfect control, was all with Foley.
The contractor had caught no sign revealing whether
his insinuative words were having effect.</p>

<p>"But you perhaps have thought of some plan that
is worth considering," he went on.</p>

<p>Foley hesitated, for the first time. "Well&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"What is it?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off, and seemed to listen with
suspicion.</p>

<p>Baxter's face quickened&mdash;the least trifle. The
three men leaned further across the table, excitement
tugging in their faces.</p>

<p>"You are perfectly safe," Baxter assured him.
"No one can hear."</p>

<p>"The plan's dead simple. But mebbe it's occurred
to youse."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>

<p>"Go on!" said Baxter. The men hardly breathed.</p>

<p>"The quickest way o' settlin' the strike is for"&mdash;he
paused&mdash;"youse bosses to give in."</p>

<p>Baxter's face went a little pale. Something very
like a snarl came from the spectators.</p>

<p>Foley gave a prolonged chuckle. "If youse'll pay
me for my time, I'm willin' to play tag in the dark so
long's the coin lasts. But if youse ain't, come to business,
or I'll go."</p>

<p>"I don't understand," returned Baxter blankly.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell the truth now an' then, Baxter. It sorter
gives contrast to the other things youse say. Youse
understand all right enough."</p>

<p>Baxter continued his blank look.</p>

<p>Foley laughed dryly. "Now why do youse keep
up that little game with me, Baxter? But keep it up,
if youse like it? It don't fool no one, so where's the
harm. I see through youse all right, even if youse
don't understand me."</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Mebbe youse'd like to have me tell youse why
youse sent for me?"</p>

<p>There was no answer.</p>

<p>"I'll tell then, since youse don't seem to want to.
I only expect to live till I'm seventy-five, so I ain't got
no time to waste on your way o' doin' business."
Tilted at his ease against the window sill, he gave
each of the four a slow glance from his sharp eyes.
"Well, youse gents sent for me to see if I wouldn't
offer to sell out the strike."</p>

<p>This was hardly the manner in which the four had
expected he would be led on to hold them up. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
was a moment of suppressed disconcertment. Then
Baxter remarked: "It seems to me that you are
doing some very unwarranted guessing."</p>

<p>"I may be wrong, sure." A sardonic grin showed
through the shadow-mask on his face. "Well, what
did youse want to talk to me about then?"</p>

<p>Again there was a pause. The three twisted in
uncomfortable suspense. Baxter had the control of
a bronze. "Suppose that was our purpose?" he
asked quietly. "What would you say?"</p>

<p>"That's pretty fair; youse're gettin' out where
there's daylight," Foley approved. "I'd say youse
was wastin' time. It can't be done&mdash;even if anybody
wanted it done."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"There's three thousand men in the union, an'
every one o' them has a say in settlin' the strike. An'
there's five men on the strike committee. I s'pose it's
necessary to tell four such honest gents that a trick o'
this sort's got to be turned on the quiet. Where's
the chance for quiet? A committee might fool a
union&mdash;yes. But there's the committee."</p>

<p>Foley looked at his watch. "I've got to move if I
keep that engagement." He stood up, and a malignant
look came over his face. "I've give youse gents
about the only sort of a reason youse're capable of
appreciatin'&mdash;I couldn't if I wanted to. But there's
another&mdash;I don't want to. The only way o' settlin'
this strike is the one I said first, for youse bosses to
give in. I've swore to beat youse out, an', by God,
I'm goin' to do it!"</p>

<p>Bobbs and Isaac blinked dazedly. Murphy rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
with a savage look, but was sent to his chair by a
glance from Baxter. Save for that glance, Foley's
words would have made no more change on Baxter's
face than had it indeed been of bronze.</p>

<p>"When youse're ready to give in, gents, send for
me, an' I'll come again. Till then, damn youse,
good-by!"</p>

<p>As his hand was on the knob Baxter's even voice
reached him: "But suppose a man could fool the
committee?"</p>

<p>Foley turned slowly around. "What?"</p>

<p>"Suppose a man could fool the committee?"</p>

<p>"What youse drivin' at?"</p>

<p>"Suppose a man could fool the committee?"</p>

<p>Foley's eyes were of blazing intentness. "It can't
be done."</p>

<p>"I know of only one man who could do it."</p>

<p>"Who?"</p>

<p>"I think you can guess his name."</p>

<p>Foley came slowly back to his chair, with a gaze
that fairly clutched Baxter's face. "Don't youse fool
with me!" he snarled.</p>

<p>Baxter showed nothing of the angler's excitement
who feels the fish on his hook. "Suppose a man
could fool the committee? What would you say?"</p>

<p>Foley held his eyes in piercing study on Baxter's
face. "See here, are youse talkin' business?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"Suppose I say I am."</p>

<p>The shadow could not hide a wolf-like gleam of
Foley's yellow teeth. "Then I might say, 'I'll
listen.'"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span></p>

<p>"Suppose a man could fool the committee," Baxter
reiterated. "What would you say?"</p>

<p>"S'pose I was to say, 'how'?"</p>

<p>Baxter felt sure of his catch. Throwing cautious
speech aside, he outlined the plan of his business
sense, Foley watching him the while with unshifting
gaze, elbows on knees, hands gripped. "Negotiations
between your committee and ours might be
resumed. You might be defiant for one or two meetings
of the two committees. You might still be defiant
in the meetings, but you might begin to drop a few
words of doubt on the outside. They will spread, and
have their effect. You can gradually grow a little
weaker in your declarations at the meetings and a little
stronger in your doubts expressed outside. Some
things might happen, harmless in themselves, which
would weaken the union's cause. Then you might
begin to say that perhaps after all it would be better
to go back to work on the old scale now, than to hold
out with the possibility of having to go back at the
old scale anyhow after having lost a summer's work.
And so on. In three weeks, or even less, you would
have the union in a mood to declare the strike off."</p>

<p>Foley's gaze dropped to the rug, and the four
waited his decision in straining suspense. The walking
delegate's mind quickly ran over all the phases of
this opportunity for a fortune. None of the four
men present would tell of the transaction, since, if
they did, they would be blackened by their own words.
To the union and all outside persons it would seem
nothing more than a lost strike. The prestige he
would lose in the union would be only temporary; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
could regain it in the course of time. Other walking
delegates had lost strikes and kept their places as
leaders.</p>

<p>Even Baxter had begun to show signs of nervous
strain when Foley raised his eyes and looked hesitatingly
at the three men. Every man was one more
mouth, so one more danger.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Baxter.</p>

<p>"I ain't used to doin' business with more'n one
man."</p>

<p>"Oh, we're all on the level," growled Murphy.
"Come out with it."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I say yes&mdash;with an 'if'."</p>

<p>"And the 'if'?" queried Baxter.</p>

<p>"If the price is right."</p>

<p>"What do you think it should be?"</p>

<p>Foley studied the men's faces from beneath lowered
eyebrows. "Fifty thousand."</p>

<p>This was the sum Baxter had mentioned the afternoon
before. But Isaacs cried out, "What!"</p>

<p>"That&mdash;or nothing!"</p>

<p>"Half that's enough," declared Murphy.</p>

<p>Foley sneered in Murphy's face. "As I happen
to know, twenty-five thousand is just what youse got
for workin' in the Board o' Aldermen for the Lincoln
Avenue Traction Franchise. Good goods
always comes higher."</p>

<p>The alderman's red face paled to a pink. But
Baxter cut in before he could retort. "We won't
haggle over the amount, Mr. Foley. I think we
can consider the sum you mention as agreed upon."</p>

<p>Foley's yellow teeth gleamed again. He summed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
up his terms concisely: "Fifty thousand, then. Paid
in advance. No checks. Cash only."</p>

<p>"Pay you in advance!" snorted Murphy. "Well
I rather guess not!"</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;we want somethin' for our money!"</p>

<p>Foley's face grew dark. "See here, gents.
We've done a little quiet business together, all of
us. Now can any one o' youse say Buck Foley ever
failed to keep his part o' the agreement?"</p>

<p>The four had to vindicate his honor. But nevertheless,
for their own reason, they seemed unwilling
to pay now and trust that he would do the work; and
Foley, for his reason, seemed unwilling to do
the work and trust that they would pay. After
much discussion a compromise was reached: the
money was to be paid by Baxter in the morning of
the day on which the union would vote upon the
strike; the committee could then feel certain that
Foley would press his measure through, for he would
have gone too far to draw back; and Foley, if payment
should not be made, could still balk the fulfillment
of the plan.</p>

<p>When this agreement had been reached Baxter
was ready with another point. "I believe it would
be wise if all our future dealings with Mr. Foley
should be in the open, especially my dealings with
him. If we were seen coming from an apparently
secret meeting, and recognized&mdash;as we might be, for
we are both known to many people&mdash;suspicions
might be aroused and our plan defeated."</p>

<p>The four gave approval to the suggestion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span></p>

<p>At five o'clock all was settled, and Foley rose to
go. He looked irresolutely at Baxter for a moment,
then said in a kind of grudging admiration: "I've
never give youse credit, Baxter. I knew youse was
the smoothest thing in the contractin' business, but
I never guessed youse was this deep."</p>

<p>For an instant Baxter had a fear that he would
again have to shake a great hairy hand. But Foley's
tribute did not pass beyond words.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">IN WHICH FOLEY BOWS TO DEFEAT</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idct.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">The minute after Foley had gone Mr.
Baxter was talking over the telephone
to the secretary of the Conciliation Committee
of the Civic Federation. "We
have considered your offer to try to bring our
committee and the committee of the ironworkers
together," he said. "We are willing to reopen
negotiations with them." A letter would have been
the proper and more dignified method of communication.
But this was the quicker, and to Mr. Baxter
a day was worth while.</p></div>

<p>The secretary believed in the high mission of his
committee, and was enthusiastic to make a record for
it in the avoidance of strikes and assistance in their
settlement. So he laid down the telephone receiver
and called for a stenographer. Within twenty
minutes a messenger left his office bearing a letter to
Foley.</p>

<p>When Foley got home, an hour after leaving Mr.
Baxter's office, his wife handed him the letter. It
read:</p>

<blockquote class="small ps">
<p class="noin">
<span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Foley:</span><br />
</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter, speaking for the Executive Committee of the Iron
Employers' Association, has signified their willingness to meet your
committee and again discuss possible measures for the ending of
the strike. Notwithstanding the barrenness of previous meetings I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
sincerely hope your committee will show the same willingness to
resume negotiations. Permit me to urge upon your attention the
extreme seriousness of the present situation: the union, the contractors,
the owners, all losing money, the public discommoded by
the delay in the completion of buildings; all these demand that
your two committees get together and in a spirit of fairness reach
some agreement whereby the present situation will be brought to
an end.</p>

<p>Our rooms are at the service of your two committees. As time is
precious I have secured Mr. Baxter's consent, for his committee, to
meet you here at half-past two to-morrow afternoon. I hope this will
suit you. If not, a later date can be arranged.</p></blockquote>

<p>Though his appetite and dinner were both ready,
Foley put on his hat and went to the home of
Connelly. The secretary was just sitting down to
his own dinner.</p>

<p>"I just happened to be goin' by," said Foley, "an'
I thought I'd run in an' show youse a letter I got
to-day." He drew out the letter and handed it to
Connelly.</p>

<p>Foley chatted with Mrs. Connelly while the letter
was being read, but all the time his eyes were watching
its effect upon Connelly. When he saw the end
had been reached, he remarked: "It don't amount
to nothin'. I guess we might as well write 'em to go
to hell."</p>

<p>Connelly hesitated. It usually took more than a
little courage to express a view contrary to Foley's.
"I don't know," he said doubtfully. "Baxter knows
how we stand. It strikes me if he offers to talk
things over with us, that means he realizes he's licked
an' is willin' to make concessions."</p>

<p>"Um! Maybe youse're right."</p>

<p>Encouraged by this admission Connelly went on:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
"It might be worth our while to meet 'em, anyhow.
Suppose nothin' does come of it, what have we lost?"</p>

<p>Foley looked half-convinced. "Well, mebbe our
committee might as well talk the letter over."</p>

<p>"Sure thing."</p>

<p>"I suppose then we ought to get together to-night.
If we get word to the other three boys, we've got to
catch 'em at dinner. Can youse see to that?"</p>

<p>Connelly looked regretfully at his untasted meal.
"I guess I can."</p>

<p>"All right. In your office then, say at eight."</p>

<p>The five men were in the office on time, though
Connelly, to make it, had to content himself with
what he could swallow in a few minutes at a quick
lunch counter. The office was a large, square room,
a desk in one corner, a few chairs along the sides, a
great cuspidor in the center; at the windows were
lace curtains, and on one wall was a full-length mirror
in a gilt frame&mdash;for on nights when Potomac Hall
was let for weddings, receptions, and balls, Connelly's
office had over its door, "Ladies' Dressing
Room."</p>

<p>The five men lit cigars, Foley's cigars, and drew
chairs around the cuspidor, which forthwith began
to bear the relation of hub to their frequent salivary
spokes. "Connelly told youse about the letter from
the Civic Federation, that's gettin' so stuck on runnin'
God's business they'll soon have him chased off his
job," Foley began. "But I guess I might as well
read the letter to youse."</p>

<p>"Take the offer, o' course!" declared Pete, when
Foley had ended.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's what I said," Connelly joined.</p>

<p>Hogan and Brown, knowing how opposed Foley
was to the proposition, said nothing.</p>

<p>"We've wasted enough time on the bosses' committee,"
Foley objected. "No use talkin' to 'em
again till we've put 'em down an' out."</p>

<p>"The trouble with you, Foley, is, you like a fight
so well you can't tell when you've licked your man,"
said Pete in an exasperated tone. "What's the use
punchin' a man after he's give in?"</p>

<p>"We've got 'em licked, or they'd never ask to
talk things over," urged Connelly.</p>

<p>Foley looked in scowling meditation at his cigar
ash. Then he raised his eyes to Brown and Hogan.
"What do youse think?"</p>

<p>Thus directly questioned; they had to admit they
stood with Pete and Connelly.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, since we ain't workin', I suppose we
won't be wastin' much if we do chin a bit with 'em,"
he conceded. But the four easily perceived that he
merely yielded to their majority, did not agree.</p>

<p>The next afternoon Foley and his committee were
led by the secretary of the Conciliation Committee
into one of the rooms of the Civic Federation's suite,
where Mr. Baxter and his committee were already in
waiting. The secretary expressed a hope that they
arrive at an understanding, and withdrew in exultation
over this example of the successful work his
committee was doing.</p>

<p>There was a new member on the employers' committee&mdash;Mr.
Berman. Mr. Baxter, exercising the
power vested in him to fill vacancies temporarily, had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
chosen Mr. Berman as Mr. Driscoll's successor for
two reasons: his observations of Mr. Berman had
made him certain the latter had elastic ideas; and,
more important, for Mr. Driscoll's own partner to
take the vacant place would quiet all suspicions as to
the cause of Mr. Driscoll's unexpected resignation.
Of the five, Bobbs and Isaacs were rather self-conscious;
Murphy, who had had previous experience in
similar situations, wore a large, blustering manner;
Berman, for all his comparative inexperience, was
most promisingly at his ease; and Baxter was the
Baxter he was three hundred and sixty-five days in the
year.</p>

<p>The strikers' committee presented the confident
front of expected victory. Foley, slipped far down
in his chair, eyed the contractors with a sideling, insolent
glance.</p>

<p>"If this here's to be another o' them hot air festivals,
like we attended in April an' May, say so now,"
he growled. "We ain't got no time for talkin' unless
youse mean business."</p>

<p>Connelly, whose chair was beside Foley's, leaned
over anxiously. "Don't you think you're goin' at
'em pretty rough, Buck?" he whispered. "If you
get 'em mad, they'll go right back to where they
stood."</p>

<p>"Oh, youse leave 'em to me," Foley returned
knowingly.</p>

<p>It would serve no purpose to give the details of
this meeting. Mr. Baxter, ignoring Foley's insolence
of manner, outlined in well-balanced sentences
the reasons that made it imperative to both sides for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
the strike to be settled, and then went on to give anew
the contractors' side of the questions at issue. Now
and then Foley broke in with comments which were
splenetic outbursts rather than effective rejoinders.
When the meeting was over and his committee was
out in the street, Foley shed his roughly defiant manner.
"Boys," he said with quiet confidence, "we've
got 'em beat to death."</p>

<p>The next afternoon was occupied with a debate
between Mr. Baxter and Foley upon their respective
claims. Foley's tongue was as sharp as ever, but his
fellow committeemen had to acknowledge to their
secret hearts there was more of convincing substance
in what Mr. Baxter said. They wondered somewhat
at the sudden declension in the effectiveness of their
leader's speech, which perhaps they would not
have done had they been parties to a conference that
morning at which Foley had pointed out to Mr. Baxter
the vulnerable spots in the union's claims, and
schooled him in the most telling replies to the statements
he, Foley, intended making.</p>

<p>After the meeting Foley again declared his certainty
of winning, but there was a notable decrease
of confidence in his voice.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Connelly, without much spirit. "But
Baxter, he puts up a good talk."</p>

<p>"He seems to have facts to talk from," explained
Brown.</p>

<p>"So have we," said Foley.</p>

<p>"Yes, but somehow at the meetin's his facts seem
stronger," said Connelly.</p>

<p>"Oh, what o' that," Foley returned encouragingly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
"More'n once in poker I've seen a strong bluff win
over a strong hand."</p>

<p>The next meeting was a repetition of the second.
Foley was keen in his wit, and insolently defiant; but
Mr. Baxter got the better of every argument. The
union's committee began to admit, each man to himself,
that their position was weaker, and the contractors'
much stronger, than they had thought.</p>

<p>And so, day by day, Foley continued to undermine
their confidence. So skillfully did he play his part,
they never guessed that he was the insinuating cause
of their failing courage; more, his constant encouragement
made them ashamed to speak of their sinking
spirit.</p>

<p>But on the fifth day, at a consultation in Connelly's
office, it came out. There had been an hour of talk,
absolutely without a touch of enthusiasm, when Connelly,
who had been looking around at the men's faces
for some time, said with an effort: "On the level
now, boys, d'you think we've got any chance o'
winnin'?"</p>

<p>Foley swore. "What's that?" he demanded.
"Why o' course we're goin' to win!"</p>

<p>But Connelly's words had their effect; the silence
broken, the men spoke hesitatingly of the growing
doubts they had been trying to hide. Foley stood up.
"Boys, if youse're goin' to talk this kind o' rot,
youse've got to talk it without me," he said, and
went out.</p>

<p>Foley gone, they spoke freely of their doubts; and
they also talked of him. "D'you notice how the
ring's all gone out o' his voice?" asked Brown.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>"I bet he ain't got no more confidence than any o'
the rest of us," said Pete.</p>

<p>"I bet so, too," agreed Connelly. "He talks big
just to cheer us up. Then it's mighty hard for Buck
to give up. He'll always fight to his last drop o'
blood."</p>

<p>The decline of the committee's enthusiasm had
already begun to have a disquieting effect in the
union. It now rapidly spread that the committee
had little confidence of winning the strike, and that
Foley, for all his encouraging words, believed at
heart as did the rest of the committee.</p>

<p>The first meeting of the union after the resumption
of negotiations was a bitter one. The committee
made a vague report, in which Foley did not join,
that made apparent their fallen courage. Immediately
questioning men were on their feet all over the
hall, Tom among them. The committee, cornered
by queries, had to admit publicly that it had no such
confidence as it had had a week before. The reasons
for this were demanded. No more definite reason
could be given than that the bosses were stronger
in their position than the union had believed.</p>

<p>There were sneers and hot words for the four
members who participated in the report. Cries went
up for Foley, who had thus far kept out of the discussion;
and one voice, answering the cries, shouted:
"Oh, he's lost his nerve, too, the same as the others!"</p>

<p>Foley was on his feet in an instant, looking over
the excited crowd. "If any man here has heard me
say I'm for givin' in, let him get up on his two feet!"</p>

<p>No one stood up. "I guess youse all know I'm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
for fightin' as long's there's anything worth fightin'
for," he declared, and sank back into his seat.</p>

<p>But there had been no wrath in his eyes as he had
looked over the crowd, and no ferocity in his words
of vindication. The whisper ran about that it was
true, he was losing his nerve. And if Foley, Foley
the fighter, were losing confidence, then the situation
must indeed be desperate.</p>

<p>The courage of a large body of men, especially of
one loosely organized, is the courage of its leaders.
Now that it was known the committee's confidence
was well-nigh gone, and guessed that Foley's was
going, the courage of the men ebbed rapidly. It
began to be said: "If there's no chance of winning
the strike, why don't we settle it at once, and get
back to work?" And the one who spoke loudest and
most often in this strain was Johnson.</p>

<p>Two days after the meeting Foley had a conference
with Mr. Baxter, at which the other members
of the union's committee were not present. And
that same night there was another explosion in one
of Mr. Baxter's buildings that chanced to be unguarded.
The explosion was slight, and small damage
was done, but a search discovered two charges of
dynamite in the foundation, with fuses burned almost
to the fulminating caps.</p>

<p>If the dynamite did not explode, the newspapers
did. The perpetrators of this second outrage, which
only fate had prevented, should be hunted down and
made such an example of as would be an eternal warning
against like atrocities. The chief of police should
apprehend the miscreants at whatever cost, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
district attorney should see that they had full justice&mdash;and
perhaps a little more.</p>

<p>The chief of police, for his part, declared he'd
have the guilty parties if it took his every man to
run them down. But his men searched, days passed,
and the waiting cells remained empty.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter, interviewed, said it was obvious that
the union was now determined to stop at nothing in
its efforts to drive the contractors into submission.
The union, at a special meeting, disclaimed any
responsibility for the attempted outrage, and intimated
that this was a scheme of the contractors themselves
to blacken the union's character. When a reporter
"conveyed this intelligence to Mr. Baxter,
that gentleman only smiled."</p>

<p>The chief result of this second explosion was that
so much as remained to the union of public sympathy
was lost in what time it took the public to read its
morning paper. Had a feeling of confidence prevailed
in the union, instead of one of growing doubt,
this charge might have incited the union to resistance
all the stouter. But the union, dispirited over the
weakness of its cause, saw its cause had been yet
further weakened, and its courage fled precipitately.</p>

<p>Three days after the explosion there was another
joint meeting of the two committees. At this Mr.
Baxter, who had before been soft courtesy, was all
ultimatum. The explosion had decided them. They
would not be intimidated; they would not make a
single concession. The union could return to work
on the old terms, if it liked; if not, they would fight
till there was nothing more to fight with, or for.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Foley, with much bravado, gave ultimatum for
ultimatum; but when his committee met, immediately
after leaving the employers', to consider Mr. Baxter's
proposition, he sat in gloomy silence, hardly heeding
what was being said. As they talked they turned
constantly to Foley's somber face, and looking at that
face their words became more and more discouraged.</p>

<p>Finally Pete asked of him: "Where d'you stand,
Buck?"</p>

<p>He came out of his reverie with a start. "I'm
against givin' up," he said. "Somethin' may turn
up yet."</p>

<p>"What's the use holdin' on?" demanded Connelly.
"We're bound to be licked in the end. Every
day we hold out the men lose a day's pay."</p>

<p>Foley glanced sadly about. "Is that what youse
all think?"</p>

<p>There were four affirmative answers.</p>

<p>"Well, I ain't goin' to stand out&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He broke off, and his face fell forward into his
palm, and he was silent for a long space. The four
watched him in wordless sympathy.</p>

<p>"Boys," he said, huskily, into his hand, "this's
the first time Buck Foley's ever been licked."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">PETERSEN'S SIN</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idct.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">The first news of the committee's failing
confidence that reached Tom's ears he
discredited as being one of the rumors that
are always flying about when large powers
are vested in a small body of men. That the strike
could fail was too preposterous for his belief. But
when the committee was forced to admit in open meeting
that its courage was waning, Tom, astounded, had
to accept what but yesterday he had discredited. He
thought immediately of treachery on Foley's part,
but in his hot remarks to the union he made no mention
of his suspicions; he knew the boomerang quality
of an accusation he could not prove. Later, when he
went over the situation with cool brain, he saw that
treachery was impossible. Granting even that Foley
could be bought, there was the rest of the committee,&mdash;and
Pete, on whose integrity he would have staked
his own, was one of its members.</p></div>

<p>And yet, for all that reason told him, a vague and
large suspicion persisted in his mind. A few days
after the meeting he had a talk with Pete, during
which his suspicion got into words. "Has it occurred
to you, Pete, that maybe Foley is up to some
deep trick?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You're away off, Tom!" was the answer, given
with some heat. "I ain't missed a single committee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
meetin', an' I know just where Foley stands. It's the
rest of us that're sorter peterin' out. Buck's the
only one that's standin' out for not givin' in. Mebbe
he's not above dumpin' us all if he had the chance.
But he couldn't be crooked here even if he wanted to.
We're too many watchin' him."</p>

<p>All this Tom had said to himself before, but his
saying it had not dispelled his suspicion, and no
more did the saying of it now by Pete. The negotiations
seemed all open and above board; he could not
lay his finger on a single flaw in them. But yet the
strike seemed to him to have been on too solid a
basis to have thus collapsed without apparent cause.</p>

<p>At the union meeting following the committee conference
where Foley had yielded, a broken man, the
advisability of abandoning the strike came up for
discussion. Foley sat back in his chair, with overcast
face, and refused to speak. But his words to the
committee had gone round, and now his gloomy
silence was more convincing in its discouragement
than any speech could have been. Tom, whose mind
could not give up the suspicion that there was trickery,
even though he could not see it, had a despairing
thought that if action could be staved off time
might make the flaw apparent. He frantically opposed
the desire of a portion of the members that the
strike be given up that very evening. Their defeat
was not difficult; the union was not yet ready for the
step. It was decided that the matter should come up
for a vote at the following meeting.</p>

<p>While Tom was at breakfast the next morning
there was a knock at the door. Maggie answered it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
and he heard a thin yet resonant voice that he seemed
to have heard before, inquire: "Is Mr. Keating in?"</p>

<p>He stepped to the door. In the dim hallway he
saw indistinctly a small, thin woman with a child in
her arms. "Yes," he answered for himself.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember me, Brother Keating?" she
asked, with a glad note in her voice, shifting the
child higher on her breast and holding out a hand.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Petersen!" he cried. "Come right in."</p>

<p>She entered, and Tom introduced her to Maggie,
who drew a chair for her up beside the breakfast
table.</p>

<p>"Thank you, sister." She sank exhausted into the
chair, and turned immediately on Tom. "Have you
seen Nels lately?" she asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"Not for more than two weeks."</p>

<p>The excitement died out of her face; Tom now
saw, by the light of the gas that had to be burned in
the dining-room even at midday, that the face was
drawn and that there were dark rings under the eyes.
"Is anything wrong?" he asked.</p>

<p>"He ain't been home for two nights," she returned
tremulously. "I said to myself last night, if he don't
come to-night I'll come over to see you early this
morning. Mebbe you'd know something about him."</p>

<p>"Not a thing." He wanted to lighten that wan
face, so he gave the best cheer that he could. "But
I guess nothing's wrong with him."</p>

<p>"Yes, there is, or he'd never stay away like this,"
she returned quickly. Her voice sank with resignation.
"I suppose all I can do is to pray."</p>

<p>"And look," Tom added. "I'll look."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span></p>

<p>She rose to go. Maggie pressed her to have breakfast,
but she refused, a faint returning hope in her
eyes. "Mebbe the Lord's brung him home while
I've been here."</p>

<p>A half minute after the door had closed upon her
Tom opened it and hurried down the three flights of
stairs. He caught her just going into the street.</p>

<p>He fumbled awkwardly in his pocket. "Do you
need anything?"</p>

<p>"No. Bless you, Brother Keating. Nels left me
plenty o' money. You know he works reg'lar on the
docks."</p>

<p>Two causes for Petersen's absence occurred as possible
to Tom&mdash;arrest and death. He looked through
the record of arrests for the last two days at police
headquarters. Petersen's name was not there, and
to give a false name would never have occurred to
Petersen's slow mind. So Tom knew he was not in
a cell. He visited the public morgues and followed
attendants who turned back sheets from cold faces.
But Petersen's face he did not see.</p>

<p>The end of the day brought also the end of
Tom's search. He now had three explanations for
Petersen's absence: The Swede was dead, and his
body unrecovered; he had wandered off in a fit of
mental aberration; he had deserted his wife. The
first he did not want to believe. The third, remembering
the looks that had passed between the two the
night he had visited their home, he could not believe.
He clung to the second; and that was the only one he
mentioned to Mrs. Petersen when he called in the
evening to report.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span></p>

<p>"He'll come to suddenly, and come back," he encouraged
her. "That's the way with such cases."</p>

<p>"You think so?" She brightened visibly.</p>

<p>A fourth explanation flashed upon him. "Perhaps
he got caught by accident on some boat he had been
helping load, and got carried away."</p>

<p>She brightened a little more at this. "Just so he's
alive!" she cried.</p>

<p>"He'll be certain to be back in a few days," Tom
said positively. He left her greatly comforted by
his words, though he himself did not half believe
them.</p>

<p>There was nothing more he could do toward discovering
the missing man. It must be admitted that,
during the next few days, he thought of Petersen
much less frequently than was the due of such a
friend as the Swede had proved. The affairs of the
union held his mind exclusively. Opinion was turning
overwhelmingly toward giving up the strike, and
giving it up immediately. Wherever there was a
man who still held out, there were three or four men
pouring words upon him. "Foley may not be so
honest as to hurt him, but he's a fighter from 'way
back, an' if he thinks we ought to stop fightin' now,
then we ought to 'a' stopped weeks ago"&mdash;such was
the substance of the reasoning in bar-room and street
that converted many a man to yielding.</p>

<p>And also, Tom learned, a quick settlement was
being urged at home. As long as the men had stood
firm for the strike, the women had skimped at every
point and supported that policy. But when they
discovered that the men's courage was going, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
women, who feel most the fierce economy of a strike,
were for the straight resumption of work and income.
Maggie, Tom knew, was beginning to look forward
in silent eagerness to a settlement; he guessed that
she hoped, the strike ended, he might go back to
work untroubled by Foley.</p>

<p>Tom undertook to stand out against the proposal
of submission, but he might as well have tried
to shoulder back a Fundy tide. Men remembered
it was he who had so hotly urged them into a strike
that thus far had cost them seven weeks' wages. "I
suppose you'd have us lose seven more weeks'
money," they sneered at him. They said other
things, and stronger, for your ironworker has studied
English in many places.</p>

<p>Monday evening found Tom in a chair at one of
the open windows of his sitting-room, staring out at
nothing at all, hardly conscious of Maggie, who
was reading, or of Ferdinand, who lay dozing on the
couch. He was completely discouraged&mdash;at the
uttermost end of things. He had searched his mind
frantically for flaws in the negotiations and in Foley's
conduct, flaws which, if followed up, clue by clue,
would reveal Foley's suspected treachery. But he
found none. There seemed nothing more he could
do. The vote would come on Wednesday evening,
and its result was as certain as if the count had
already been made.</p>

<p>And so he sat staring into the line of back yards
with their rows and rows of lighted windows. His
mind moved over the past five months. They had
held nothing for him but failure and pain. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
had fought for honor in the management of the
union's affairs, staking his place in his trade on the
result&mdash;and honor in the contest with dishonesty
had gone down in defeat. He had urged the union
to strike for better wages, and now the strike was on
the eve of being lost. He would have to begin life
over anew, and he did not know where he could
begin. Moreover, he had lost all but a few friends;
and he had lost all influence. This was what his
fight for right had brought him, and in five months.</p>

<p>And this was not the sum of the bitterness the five
months had brought him&mdash;no, nor its greater part.
He had learned how mighty real love can be&mdash;and
how hopeless!</p>

<p>He had been sitting so, dreaming darkly, for an
hour or more when Maggie asked him if he had
heard whether Petersen had come back. The question
brought to his mind that he had neglected Mrs.
Petersen for four days. He rose, conscience-smitten,
told Maggie he would be back presently, and
set forth for the tenement in which the Petersens
had their home. He found Mrs. Petersen, her child
asleep in her lap, reading the Bible. She appeared
to be even slighter and paler than when he had last
seen her, but her spirit seemed to burn even higher
through the lessened obscuration of her thinning
flesh.</p>

<p>No, Petersen had not yet come back. "But I
fetched my trouble to God in prayer," she said.
"An' He helped me, glory to His name! He told me
Nels is comin' back."</p>

<p>Tom had nothing to give to one so fired by hope,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
and he slipped away as soon as he could and returned
home. On entering his flat, his eyes going straight
through the dining-room into the sitting-room, he saw
Maggie gazing in uncomfortable silence at a man&mdash;a
lean, brown man, with knobby face, and wing-like
mustache, who sat with bony hands in his lap and
eyes fastened on his knees.</p>

<p>Tom crossed the dining-room with long strides.
Maggie, glad of the chance to escape, passed into the
bedroom.</p>

<p>"Petersen!" he cried. "Where on earth've you
been?"</p>

<p>Petersen rose with a glad light in his face and
grasped the hand Tom offered. Immediately he
disengaged his hand to slip it into a trousers pocket.
Tom now noted that Petersen's face was slightly
discolored,&mdash;dim yellows, and greens, and blues&mdash;and
that his left thumb was brown, as though stained
with arnica.</p>

<p>"I come to pay vot I loan," Petersen mumbled.
His hand came forth from the pocket grasping a
roll of bills as big as his wrist. He unwrapped three
tens and silently held them out.</p>

<p>Tom, who had watched this action through with
dumb amazement, now broke out: "Where d'you
get all that money? Where've you been?"</p>

<p>The three tens were still in Petersen's outstretched
hand. "For vot you give de union, and vot you give
me."</p>

<p>"But where've you been?" Tom demanded, taking
the money.</p>

<p>Fear, shame, and contrition struggled for control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span>
of Petersen's face. But he answered doggedly: "I
vorked at de docks."</p>

<p>"You know that's not so, Petersen. You haven't
been home for a week. And your wife's scared half
to death."</p>

<p>"Anna scared? Vy?" He started, and his
brown face paled.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't she be?" Tom returned wrathfully.
"You went off without a word to her, and
not a word from you for a week! Now see here,
Petersen, where've you been?"</p>

<p>"Vorkin' at de docks," he repeated, but weakly.</p>

<p>"And got that wad of money for it! Hardly."
He pushed Petersen firmly back into his chair.
"Now you've got to tell me all about it."</p>

<p>All the dogged resistance faded from Petersen's
manner, and he sat trembling, with face down. For
a moment Tom was in consternation lest he break
into tears. But he controlled himself and in shame
told his story, aided by questions from Tom. Tom
heard him without comment, breathing rapidly and
gulping at parts of the brokenly-told story.</p>

<p>When the account was ended Tom gripped Petersen's
hand. "You're all right, Petersen!" he said
huskily.</p>

<p>Tears trickled down from Petersen's eyes, and his
simple face twitched with remorse.</p>

<p>Tom fell into thought. He understood Petersen's
fear to face his wife. He, too, was uncertain how
Mrs. Petersen, in her religious fervor, would regard
what Petersen had done. He had to tell her, of
course, since Petersen had shown he could not. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Pg 299]</a></span>
how should he tell her&mdash;how, so that the woman,
and not the religious enthusiast, would be reached?</p>

<p>Presently Tom handed Petersen his hat, and
picked up his own. "Come on," he said; and to
Maggie he called through the bedroom door: "I'll
be back in an hour."</p>

<p>As they passed through the tunnel Tom, who had
slipped his hand through Petersen's arm for guidance,
felt the Swede begin to tremble; and it was
so across the little stone-paved court, with the square
of stars above, and up the nervous stairway, whose
February odors had been multiplied by the June
warmth. Before his own door Petersen held back.</p>

<p>Tom understood. "Wait here for me, then," he
said, and knocked upon the door.</p>

<p>"Who's there?" an eager voice questioned.</p>

<p>"Keating."</p>

<p>When she answered, the eagerness in the voice
had turned to disappointment. "All right, Brother
Keating. In just a minute."</p>

<p>Tom heard the sounds of rapid dressing, and then
a hand upon the knob. Petersen shrank back into
the darkness of a corner.</p>

<p>The door opened. "Come in, Brother Keating,"
she said, not quite able to hide her surprise at this
second visit in one evening.</p>

<p>A coal oil lamp on the kitchen table revealed the
utter barrenness and the utter cleanness&mdash;so far as
unmonied effort could make clean those scaling walls
and that foot-hollowed floor&mdash;which he had seen on
his first visit five months before. He was hardly
within the door when her quick eyes caught the strain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span>
in his manner. One thin hand seized his arm excitedly.
"What is it, brother? Have you heard from
Nels?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es," Tom admitted hesitatingly. He had not
planned to begin the story so.</p>

<p>"And he's alive? Quick! He's alive?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>She sank into a chair, clasped both hands over her
heart, and turned her eyes upward. "Praise the
Lord! I thank Thee, Lord! I knew Thou wouldst
keep him."</p>

<p>Immediately her wide, burning eyes were back on
Tom. "Where is he?"</p>

<p>"He's been very wicked," said Tom, shaking his
head sadly, and lowering himself into the only other
chair. "So wicked he's afraid you can never forgive
him. And I don't see how you can. He's afraid to
come home."</p>

<p>"God forgives everything to the penitent, an' I
try to follow after God," she said, trembling. A sickening
fear was on her face. "Tell me, brother!
What's he done? Don't try to spare me! God will
help me to bear it. Not&mdash;not&mdash;murder?"</p>

<p>"No. He's fallen in another way," Tom returned,
with the sad shake of his head again.
"Shall I tell you all?"</p>

<p>"All, brother! An' quickly!" She leaned toward
him, hands gripped in the lap of her calico wrapper,
with such a staring, fearing attention as seemed to
stand out from her gray face and be of itself a separate
presence.</p>

<p>"I'll have to tell you some things you know al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>ready,
and know better than I do," Tom said, watching
to see how his words worked upon her. "After
Petersen got in the union he held a job for two
weeks. Then Foley knocked him out, and then came
the strike. It's been eleven weeks since he earned a
cent at his trade. The money he'd made in the
two weeks he worked soon gave out. He tried to
find work and couldn't. Days passed, and weeks.
They had little to eat at home. I guess they had a
pretty hard time of it. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"We did, brother!"</p>

<p>"He saw his wife and kid falling off&mdash;getting
weaker and weaker," Tom went on, not heeding the
interruption. "He got desperate; he couldn't see
'em starve. Now the devil always has temptation
ready for a desperate man. About four weeks ago
when his wife was so weak she could hardly move,
and there wasn't a bite in the house, the devil tempted
Petersen. He happened to meet a man who had
been his partner in his old wicked days, his manager
when he was a prize fighter. The manager said it
was too bad Petersen had left the ring; he was
arranging a heavy-weight bout to come off before a
swell athletic club in Philadelphia, a nice purse for
the loser and a big fat one for the winner. They
walked along the street together for awhile, and all
the time the devil was tempting Petersen, saying to
him: 'Go in and fight&mdash;this once. It's right for a
man to do anything rather than let his wife and kid
starve.' But Petersen held out, getting weaker all
the time, though. Then the devil said to him: 'He's
a pretty poor sort of a man that loves his promise not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
to fight more than he loves his wife and kid.' Petersen
fell. He decided to commit the sin."</p>

<p>Tom paused an instant, then added in a hard voice:
"But because a man loves his wife so much he's willing
to do anything for her, that don't excuse the sin,
does it?"</p>

<p>"Go on!" she entreated, leaning yet further
toward him.</p>

<p>"Well, he said to the manager he'd fight. They
settled it, and the man advanced some money. Petersen
went into training. But he was afraid to tell
us what an awful thing he was doing,&mdash;doing because
he didn't want his wife to starve,&mdash;and so he told us
he was working at the docks. So it was for three
weeks, and his wife and kid had things to eat. The
fight came off last Wednesday night&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And who won? Who?"</p>

<p>"Well&mdash;Petersen."</p>

<p>"Yes! Of course!" she cried, exultation for the
moment possessing her face. "He is a terrible
fighter! He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She broke off and bowed her head with sudden
shame; when it came up the next instant she wore
again the tense look that seemed the focus of her
being.</p>

<p>Tom had gone right on. "It was a hard fight.
He was up against a fast hard hitter. But he fought
better than he ever did before. I suppose he was
thinking of his wife and kid. He won, and got the
big purse. But after the fight was over, he didn't
dare come home. His face was so bruised his wife
would have known he'd been fighting,&mdash;and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>
knew it would break her heart for her to know he'd
been at it again. And so he thought he'd stay away
till his face got well. She needn't ever have the
pain then of knowing how he'd sinned. He never
even thought how worried she'd be at not hearing
from him. So he stayed away till his face got well,
almost&mdash;till to-night. Then he came back, and
slipped up to his door. He wanted to come in, but
he was still afraid. He listened at the door. His
wife was praying for him, and one thing he heard
was, she asked God to keep him wherever he was
from wrong-doing. He knew then he'd have to tell
her all about it, and he knew how terrible his sin
would seem to her. He knew she could never forgive
him. So he slipped down the stairs, and went
away. Of course he was right about what his wife
would think," Tom drove himself on with implacable
voice. "I didn't come here to plead for him. I
don't blame you. It was a terrible sin, a sin&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She rose tremblingly from her chair, and raised a
thin authoritative hand. "Stop right there,
brother!" she cried, her voice sob-broken. "It
wasn't a sin. It&mdash;it was glorious!"</p>

<p>Tom sprang toward the door. "Petersen!" he
shouted. He flung it open, and the next instant
dragged Petersen, shrinking and eager, fearful,
shamefaced, and yet glowing, into the room.</p>

<p>"Oh, Nels!" She rushed into his arms, and their
mighty length tightened about the frail body. "It&mdash;was&mdash;glorious&mdash;Nels!
It&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Tom heard no more. He closed the door
and groped down the shivering stairway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE THOUSANDTH CHANCE</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idcm.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="M" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">Mr. Driscoll was the chairman of the
building committee of a little independent
church whose membership was inclined
to regard him somewhat dubiously,
notwithstanding the open liking of the pastor. The
church was planning a new home, and of late the
committee had been holding frequent meetings. In
the afternoon of this same Monday there had been
a session of the committee; and on leaving the pastor's
study Mr. Driscoll had hurried to his office,
but Ruth, whom he had pressed into service as the
committee's secretary, had stopped to perform a number
of errands. When she reached the office she
walked through the open hall door&mdash;the weather
was warm, so it had been wide all day&mdash;over the
noiseless rug to her desk, and began to remove her
hat. Voices came to her from Mr. Driscoll's room,
Mr. Driscoll's voice and Mr. Berman's; but their
first few sentences, on business matters, passed her
ears unheeded, like the thousand noises of the street.
But presently, after a little pause, Mr. Berman
remarked upon a new topic: "Well, it's the
same as settled that the strike will be over in two
days."</p></div>

<p>Almost unconsciously Ruth's ears began to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>
in the words, though she continued tearing the sheets
of stamps, one of her purchases, into strips, preparatory
to putting them away.</p>

<p>"Another case in which right prevails," said Mr.
Driscoll, a touch of sarcasm in his voice.</p>

<p>"Why, yes. We are altogether in the right."</p>

<p>"And so we win." Silence. Then, abruptly, and
with more sarcasm: "But how much are we paying
Foley?"</p>

<p>Ruth started, as when amid the street's thousand
noises one's own name is called out. She gazed
intently at the door, which was slightly ajar.</p>

<p>Silence. "What? You know that?"</p>

<p>"Why do you suppose I left the committee?"</p>

<p>"I believed what you said, that you were tired
of it."</p>

<p>"Um! So they never told you. Since you're a
member of the committee I'm breaking no pledge in
telling you where I stand. I left when they proposed
buying Foley&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Berman made a hushing sound.</p>

<p>"Nobody'll hear. Miss Arnold's out. Besides, I
wouldn't mind much if somebody did hear, and give
the whole scheme away. How you men can stand
for it is more than I know."</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all right," Mr. Berman returned easily.</p>

<p>The talk went on, but Ruth listened for no more.
She hastily pinned on her hat, passed quietly into the
hall, and caught a descending elevator. After a walk
about the block she came back to the office and moved
around with all the legitimate noise she could make.
Mr. Driscoll's door softly closed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span></p>

<p>In a few minutes Mr. Berman came out and, door
knob in hand, regarded her a moment as she sat at
her desk making a pretense of being at work. Then
he crossed the room with a rare masculine grace and
bent above her.</p>

<p>"Miss Arnold," he said.</p>

<p>Ruth rarely took dictation from Mr. Berman, but
she now reached for her note-book in instinctive
defense against conversation. "Some work for me?"
She did not look up.</p>

<p>"Something for you to make a note of, but no
work," he returned in his low, well-modulated voice
that had seemed to her the very vocalization of
gentlemanliness. "I remember the promise you made
me give&mdash;during business hours, only business. But
I have been looking for a chance all day to break it.
I want to remind you again that the six months are
up to-morrow night."</p>

<p>"Yes. My answer will be ready."</p>

<p>He waited for her to say something more, but
she did not; and he passed on to his own room.</p>

<p>Ruth had two revelations to ponder; but it was
to the sudden insight she had been given into the
real cause of the contractors' approaching victory
that she gave her first thought, and not to the sudden
insight into the character of Mr. Berman.
From the first minute there was no doubt as to what
she should do, and yet there was a long debate in
her mind. If she were to give Tom the bare fact
that had been revealed to her, and, using it as a clue,
he were to uncover the whole plan, there would come
a disgraceful exposure involving her uncle, her em<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Pg 307]</a></span>ployers,
and, to a degree, all the steel contractors.
And another sentiment threw its influence against
disclosing her information: her natural shrinking
from opening communication with Tom; and mixed
with this was a remnant of her resentment that he
had treated her so. She had instinctively placed
him beside Mr. Berman, and had been compelled to
admit with pain: "Mr. Berman would never have
done it."</p>

<p>But her sense of right was of itself enough to
have forced her to make the one proper use of the
information chance had given her; and besides this
sense of right there was her love, ready for any
sacrifice. So she covertly scribbled the following
note to Tom:</p>

<blockquote class="small ps">
<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">My Dear Mr. Keating</span>:</p>

<p>Are you sure Mr. Foley is not playing the union false?</p>

<p class="deepind">
<span class="smcap">Ruth Arnold.</span><br />
</p>

<p>He is.</p></blockquote>

<p>With curious femininity she had, at the last
moment, tried to compromise, suggesting enough by
her question to furnish a clue to Tom, and yet
saying so little that she could tell herself she had
really not betrayed her friends; and then, in two
words, she had impulsively flung him all her
knowledge.</p>

<p>The note written, she thought of the second revelation;
of the Mr. Berman she had really liked so well
for his æsthetic taste, for his irreproachable gentlemanliness,
for all the things Tom was not. "Oh, it's
all right," he had said easily. And she placed him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>
beside Tom, and admitted with pain-adulterated
happiness: "Mr. Keating would never have done
that."</p>

<p>When her work for the day was over she hurried
to the postoffice in Park Row and dropped the
letter into the slot marked "Special Delivery."
And when Tom came back from his second call at
the Petersen home Maggie was awaiting him with
it. At sight of the handwriting on the envelope the
color left his face. He tore open the envelope with
an eagerness he tried to conceal in an assumed carelessness,
and read the score of words.</p>

<p>When he looked up from the note, Maggie's eyes
were fastened on his face. A special delivery letter
had never come to their home before. "What is
it?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Just a note about the strike," he answered, and
put the letter into his pocket.</p>

<p>The explanation did not satisfy Maggie, but, as
it was far past their bedtime, she turned slowly and
went into the bedroom.</p>

<p>"I'm not coming to bed for a little while," he
called to her.</p>

<p>The next minute he was lost in the excitement
begotten by the letter. It was true, then, what he
had suspected. Ruth, he knew, would never have
written the note unless she had been certain. His
head filled with a turmoil of thoughts&mdash;every third
one about Ruth; but these he tried to force aside,
for he was face to face with a crisis and needed all
his brain. And some of his thoughts were appalling
ones that the union was so perilously near its betrayal;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>
and some were exultant, that he was right after all.
But amid this mental turmoil one thought, larger than
any of the others, with wild steadfastness held the
central place of his brain: there was a chance that,
even yet, he could circumvent Foley and save the
union&mdash;that, fallen as low as he was, he might yet
triumph.</p>

<p>But by what plan? He was more certain than ever
of Foley's guilt, but he could not base a denunciation
of Foley upon mere certitude, unsupported by a single
fact. He had to have facts. And how to get them?
One wild plan after another acted itself out as a play
in his excited brain, in which he had such theatric
parts as descending accusingly upon Mr. Baxter and
demanding a confession, or cunningly trapping Foley
into an admission of the truth, or gaining it at point
of pistol. As the hours passed his brain quieted somewhat,
and he more quickly saw the absurdity of
schemes of this sort. But he could find no practicable
plan, and a frantic fear began to possess him: the
meeting was less than two days off, and as yet he saw
no effective way of balking the sale of the strike.</p>

<p>He sat with head on the table, he lay on the couch,
he softly paced the floor; and when the coming day
sent its first dingy light into the back yards and into
the little sitting-room he was still without a feasible
scheme. A little later he turned down the gas and
went into the street. He came back after two hours,
still lacking a plan, but quieter and with better control
of his mind.</p>

<p>"I suppose you settled the strike last night?"
said Maggie, who was preparing breakfast.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[Pg 310]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can hardly say I did," he returned abstractedly.</p>

<p>She did not immediately follow up her query, but
in a few minutes she came into the sitting-room where
Tom sat. Determination had marked her face with
hard lines. "You're planning something," she began.
"And it's about the strike. It was that letter that
kept you up all night. Now you're scheming to put
off settling the strike, ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;suppose I am?" he asked quietly. He
avoided her eyes, and looked across at the opposite
windows that framed instant-long pictures of hurrying
women.</p>

<p>"I know you are. I've been doing some thinking,
too, while you were out this morning, and it was an
easy guess for me to know that when you thought all
night you weren't thinking about anything else except
how you could put off ending up the strike."</p>

<p>One thing that his love for Ruth had shown Tom
was that mental companionship could, and should,
exist between man and wife; and one phase of his
gentleness with Maggie was that latterly he had
striven to talk to her of such matters as formerly he
had spoken of only out of his own home.</p>

<p>"Yes, you're right; I am thinking what you say,"
he began, knowing he could trust her with his precious
information. "But you don't understand, Maggie.
I am thinking how I can defeat settling the
strike because I know Foley is selling the union out."</p>

<p>Incredulity smoothed out a few of Maggie's hard
lines. "You can prove it?"</p>

<p>"I am going to try to get the facts."</p>

<p>"How?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know," he had to admit, after a pause.</p>

<p>She gave a little laugh, and the hard lines came
back. "Another crazy plan. You lose the best job
you ever had. You try to beat Foley out as walking
delegate, and get beat. You start a strike; it's the
same as lost. You push yourself into that Avon business&mdash;and
you're only out on bail, and we'll never live
down the disgrace. You've ruined us, and disgraced
us, and yet you ain't satisfied. Here you are with
another scheme. And what are you going on? Just
a guess, nothing else, that Foley's selling out!"</p>

<p>Tom took it all in silence.</p>

<p>"Now you listen to me!" Her voice was fiercely
mandatory, yet it lacked something of its old-time
harshness; Tom's gentleness had begun to rouse its
like in her. "Everything you've tried lately has been
a failure. You know that. Now don't make us any
worse off than we are&mdash;and you will if you try another
fool scheme. For God's sake, let the strike be settled
and get back to work!"</p>

<p>"I suppose you think you're right, Maggie. But&mdash;you
don't understand," he returned helplessly.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do understand," she said grimly. "And I
not only think I'm right, but I know I'm right.
Who's been right every time?"</p>

<p>Tom did not answer her question, and after looking
down on him a minute longer, she said, "You remember
what I've just told you," and returned to the preparation
of breakfast.</p>

<p>As soon as he had eaten Tom escaped into the
street and made for the little park that had once been
a burying-ground. Here his mind set to work again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>
It was more orderly now, and soon he was proceeding
systematically in his search for a plan by the method
of elimination. Plan after plan was discarded as
the morning hurried by, till he at length had this left
as the only possibility, to follow Baxter and Foley
every minute during this day and the next. But
straightway he saw the impossibility of this only possible
plan: he and any of his friends were too well
known by Foley to be able to shadow him, even had
they the experience to fit them for such work. A few
minutes later, however, this impossibility was gone.
He could hire detectives.</p>

<p>He turned the plan over in his mind. There was,
perhaps, but one chance in a thousand the detectives
would discover anything&mdash;perhaps hardly that. But
this fight was his fight for life, and this one chance
was his last chance.</p>

<p>At noon a private detective agency had in its safe
Petersen's thirty dollars and a check for the greater
part of Tom's balance at the bank.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE EXPOSURE</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idct.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">Tom's arrangement with the detective
agency was that Baxter and Foley were to
be watched day and night, and that he
was to have as frequent reports as it was
possible to give. Just before six o'clock that same
afternoon he called at the office for his first report.
It was ready&mdash;a minute account of the movements
of the two men between one and five. There was
absolutely nothing in it of value to him, except that
its apparent completeness was a guarantee that if
anything was to be found the men on the case would
find it.</p></div>

<p>Never before in Tom's life had there been as many
hours between an evening and a morning. He dared
not lessen his suspense and the hours by discussing his
present move with friends; they could not help him,
and, if he told them, there was the possibility that
some word might slip to Foley which would rouse
suspicion and destroy the thousandth chance. But at
length morning came, and at ten o'clock Tom was at
the detective agency. Again there was a minute report,
the sum of whose worth to him was&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>He went into the street and walked, fear and suspense
mounting higher and higher. In ten hours the
union would meet to decide, and as yet he had no bit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>
of evidence. At twelve o'clock he was at the office
again. There was nothing for him. Eight more
hours. At two o'clock, dizzy and shaking from suspense,
he came into the office for the third time that
day. A report was waiting.</p>

<p>He glanced it through, then trying to speak calmly,
said to the manager: "Send anything else to my
house."</p>

<p>Tom had said to himself that he had one chance in
a thousand. But this was a miscalculation. His
chance had been better than that, and had been made
so by Mr. Baxter's shrewd arrangement for his dealings
with Foley, based upon his theory that one of the
surest ways of avoiding suspicion is to do naturally
and openly the thing you would conceal. Mr. Baxter's
theory overlooked the possibility that suspicion
might already be roused and on watch.</p>

<p>Tom did not look at the sheet of paper in the hallway
or in the street; with three thousand union men in
the street, all of whom knew him, one was likely to
pounce upon him at any minute and gain his secret
prematurely. With elation hammering against his
ribs, he hurried through a cross street toward the
little park, which in the last five months had come to
be his study. The sheet of paper was buttoned
tightly in his coat, but all the time his brain was reading
a few jerky phrases in the detail-packed report.</p>

<p>In the park, and on a bench having the seclusion of
a corner, he drew the report from his pocket and read
it eagerly, several times. Here was as much as he
had hoped for&mdash;evidence that what he had suspected
was true. With the few relevant facts of the report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>
as a basis he began to reconstruct the secret proceedings
of the last three weeks. At each step he tested
conjectures till he found the only one that perfectly
fitted all the known circumstances. Progress from
the known backward to the unknown was not difficult,
and by five o'clock the reconstruction was complete.
He then began to lay his plans for the evening.</p>

<p>Tom preferred not to face Maggie, with her demands
certain to be repeated, so he had his dinner in a
restaurant whose only virtue was its cheapness. At
half past seven he arrived at Potomac Hall, looking
as much his usual self as he could. He passed with
short nods the groups of men who stood before the
building&mdash;some of whom had once been his supporters,
but who now nodded negligently&mdash;and
entered the big bar-room. There were perhaps a
hundred men here, all talking loudly; but comparatively
few were drinking or smoking&mdash;money was too
scarce. He paused an instant just within the door
and glanced about. The men he looked for were not
there, and he started rapidly across the room.</p>

<p>"Hello, Keating! How's your strike?" called
one of the crowd, a man whom, two months before, he
himself had convinced a strike should be made.</p>

<p>"Eat-'Em-Up Keating, who don't know when he's
had enough!" shouted another, with a jeer.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Keating!" cried a third, and
led off with a groan. The three groans were given
heartily, and at their end the men broke into laughter.</p>

<p>Tom burned at these crude insults, but kept straight
on his way.</p>

<p>There were also friends in the crowd,&mdash;a few.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
When the laughter died down one cried out: "What's
the matter with Keating?" The set answer came,
"He's all right!"&mdash;but very weak. It was followed
by an outburst of groans and hisses.</p>

<p>As Tom was almost at the door the stub of a cigar
struck smartly beneath his ear, and the warm ashes
slipped down inside his collar. There was another
explosion of laughter. Tom whirled about, and with
one blow sent to the floor the man who had thrown
the cigar. The laugh broke off, and in the sudden
quiet Tom passed out of the bar-room and joined the
stream of members going up the broad stairway and
entering the hall.</p>

<p>The hall was more than half filled with men&mdash;some
sitting patiently in their chairs, some standing
with one foot on chair seats, some standing in the
aisles and leaning against the walls, all discussing the
same subject, the abandonment of the strike. The
general mood of the men was one of bitter eagerness,
as it was also the mood of the men below, for all
their coarse jesting,&mdash;the bitterness of admitted defeat,
the eagerness to be back at their work without
more delay.</p>

<p>Tom glanced around, and immediately he saw Petersen
coming toward him, his lean brown face glowing.</p>

<p>"Hello, Petersen. I was looking for you," he said
in a whisper when the Swede had gained his side.
"I want you by me to-night."</p>

<p>"Yah."</p>

<p>Petersen's manner announced that he wanted to
speak, and Tom now remembered, what he had for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>gotten
in his two days' absorption, the circumstances
under which he had last seen the Swede. "How are
things at home?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Ve be goin' to move. A better house." After
this bit of loquacity Petersen smiled blissfully&mdash;and
said no more.</p>

<p>Tom told Petersen to join him later, and then
hurried over to Barry and Jackson, whom he saw
talking with a couple other of his friends in the
front of the hall. "Boys, I want to tell you something
in a minute," he whispered. "Where's Pete?"</p>

<p>"The committee's havin' a meetin' in Connelly's
office," answered Barry.</p>

<p>Tom hurried to Connelly's office and knocked.
"Come in," a voice called, and he opened the door.
The five men were just leaving their chairs.</p>

<p>"Hello, Pete. Can I see you as soon's you're
through?" Tom asked.</p>

<p>"Sure. Right now."</p>

<p>Connelly improved the opportunity by offering
Tom some advice, emphasized in the customary manner,
and ended with the request: "Now for God's
sake, keep your wind-hole plugged up to-night!"</p>

<p>Tom did not reply, but as he was starting away
with Pete he heard Foley say to the secretary:
"Youse can't blame him, Connelly. Some o' the
rest of us know it ain't so easy to give up a fight."</p>

<p>Tom found Barry, Petersen and the three others
waiting, and with them was Johnson, who having
noticed Tom whispering to them had carelessly joined
the group during his absence. "If you fellows'll step
back here I'll finish that little thing I was telling," he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
said, and led the way to a rear corner, a dozen yards
away from the nearest group.</p>

<p>When he turned to face the six, he found there
were seven. Johnson had followed. Tom hesitated.
He did not care to speak before Johnson; he had
always held that person in light esteem because of his
variable opinions. And he did not care to ask Johnson
to leave; that course might beget a scene which in
turn would beget suspicion. It would be better to
speak before him, and then see that he remained with
the group.</p>

<p>"Don't show the least surprise while I'm talking;
act like it was nothing at all," he began in a whisper.
And then he told them in a few sentences what he
had discovered, and what he planned to do.</p>

<p>They stared at him in astonishment. "Don't look
like that or you'll give away that we've got a scheme
up our sleeves," he warned them. "Now I want you
fellows to stand by me. There may be trouble.
Come on, let's get our seats. The meeting will open
pretty soon."</p>

<p>He had already picked out a spot, at the front end
on the right side, the corner formed by the wall and
the grand piano. He now led the way toward this.
Half-way up the aisle he chanced to look behind him.
There were only six men. Johnson was gone.</p>

<p>"Take the seats up there," he whispered, and
hurried out of the hall, with a fear that Johnson at
that minute might be revealing what he had heard to
Foley. But when he reached the head of the stairway
he saw at its foot Foley, Hogan, and Brown
starting slowly up. With sudden relief he turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Pg 319]</a></span>
back and joined his party. A little later Connelly
mounted the platform and gave a few preliminary
raps on his table, and Johnson was forgotten.</p>

<p>The men standing about the hall found seats.
Word was sent to the members loitering below that
the meeting was beginning, and they came up in a
straggling body, two hundred strong. Every chair
was filled; men had to stand in the aisles, and along
the walls, and in the rear where there were no seats.
It was the largest gathering of the union there had
been in three years. Tom noted this, and was glad.</p>

<p>All the windows were open, but yet the hall was
suffocatingly close. Hundreds of cigars were momently
making it closer, and giving the upper stratum
of the room's atmosphere more and more the appearance
of a solid. Few coats were on; they hung over
the arms of those standing, and lay in the laps of
those who sat. Connelly, putting down his gavel,
took off his collar and tie and laid them on his table,
an example that was given the approval of general
imitation. Everywhere faces were being mopped.</p>

<p>Connelly rapped again, and stood waiting till quiet
had spread among the fifteen hundred men. "I
guess you all know what we're here for," he began.
"If there's no objection I guess we can drop the regular
order o' business and get right to the strike."</p>

<p>There was a general cry of "consent."</p>

<p>"Very well. Then first we'll hear from the strike
committee."</p>

<p>Foley, as chairman of the strike committee, should
have spoken for it; but the committee, being aware
of the severe humiliation he was suffering, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span>
save him what public pain it could, had sympathetically
decided that some other member should deliver
its report. And Foley, with his cunning that extended
even to the smallest details, had suggested Pete, and
Pete had been selected.</p>

<p>Pete now rose, and with hands on Tom's shoulders,
calmly spoke what the committee had ordered. The
committee's report was that it had nothing new to
report. After carefully considering every circumstance
it saw no possible way of winning the strike.
It strongly advised the union to yield at once, as
further fighting meant only further loss of wages.</p>

<p>Pete was hardly back in his seat when it was moved
and seconded that the union give up the strike. A
great stamping and cries of "That's right!" "Give
it up!" "Let's get back to work!" joined to give
the motion a tremendous uproar of approval.</p>

<p>"You have heard the motion," said Connelly.
"Any remarks?"</p>

<p>Men sprang up in all parts of the crowd, and for
over an hour there were brief speeches, every one in
favor of yielding. In substance they were the same:
"Since the strike's lost, let's get back to work and not
lose any more wages." Every speaker was applauded
with hand-clapping, stamps, and shouts; an enthusiasm
for retreat had seized the crowd. Foley was
called for, but did not respond. Other speakers did,
however, and the enthusiasm developed to the spirit
of a panic. Through speeches, shouts, and stamping
Tom sat quietly, biding his time.</p>

<p>Several of the speakers made bitter flings at the
leadership that had involved them in this disastrous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[Pg 321]</a></span>
strike. Finally one man, spurred to abandon by applause,
ended his hoarse invective by moving the expulsion
of the members who had led the union into
the present predicament. So far Foley had sat with
face down, without a word, in obvious dejection.
But when this last speaker was through he rose slowly
to his feet. At sight of him an eager quiet possessed
the meeting.</p>

<p>"I can't say's I blame youse very much for what
youse've said," he began, in a voice that was almost
humble, looking toward the man who had just sat
down. "I helped get the union into the strike, yes,
an' I want youse boys"&mdash;his eyes moved over the
crowd&mdash;"to give me all the blame that's comin' to
me."</p>

<p>A pause. "But I ain't the only one. I didn't do
as much to bring on the strike as some others." His
glance rested on Tom. "The fact is, I really didn't
go in for the strike till I saw all o' youse seemed to
be in for it. Then o' course I did, for I'm always
with youse. An' I fought hard, so long's there was a
chance. Mebbe there's a few"&mdash;another glance at
Tom&mdash;"that'd like to have us keep on fightin'&mdash;an'
starve. Blame me all youse want to, boys&mdash;but
Buck Foley don't want none o' youse to starve."</p>

<p>He sank slowly back into his chair. "You did
your best, Buck!" a voice shouted, and a roar of
cheers went up. To those near him he seemed to
brighten somewhat at this encouragement.</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Keating!" cried the man who
had raised this shout in the bar-room, springing to his
feet. And again he led off with three groans, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Pg 322]</a></span>
the crowd swelled to a volume matching the cheers
for Foley. Connelly, in deference to his office,
pounded with his gavel and called for silence&mdash;but
weakly.</p>

<p>Tom flushed and his jaw tightened, but he kept his
seat.</p>

<p>The crowd began once more to demand Foley's
views on the question before the house. He shook
his head at Connelly, as he had repeatedly done before.
But the meeting would not accept his negative.
They added the clapping of hands and the stamping
of feet to their cries. Foley came up a second time,
with most obvious reluctance.</p>

<p>"I feel sorter like the man that was run over by
a train an' had his tongue cut out," he began, making
what the union saw was a hard effort to smile. "I
don't feel like sayin' much.</p>

<p>"It seems to me that everything worth sayin' has
been said already," he went on in his previous humble,
almost apologetic, tone. "What I've got to say
I'll say in the shadow of a minute. I size up the
whole thing like this: We went into this strike thinkin'
we'd win, an' because we needed more money. An'
boys, we ought to have it! But we made a mistake
somewhere. I guess youse've found out that in
a fight it ain't always the man that's right that wins.
It's the strongest man. The same in a strike. We're
right, and we've fought our best, but the other fellows
are settin' on our chests. I guess our mistake was,
we wasn't as strong when we went into the fight as
we thought we was.</p>

<p>"Now the question, as I see it, is: Do we want<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Pg 323]</a></span>
to keep the other fellow on our chests, we all fagged
out, with him mebbe punchin' our faces whenever he
feels like it?&mdash;keep us there till we're done up forever?
Or do we want to give in an' say we've had
enough? He'll let us up, we'll take a rest, we'll get
back our wind an' strength, an' when we're good an'
ready, why, another fight, an' better luck! I know
which is my style, an' from what youse boys've said
here to-night, I can make a pretty good guess as to
what's your style."</p>

<p>He paused for a moment, and when he began
again his voice was lower and there was a deep sadness
in it that he could not hide. "Boys, this is the
hardest hour o' my life. I ain't very used to losin'
fights. I think youse can count in a couple o' days
all the fights I lost for youse. [A cry, "Never a
one, Buck!"] An' it comes mighty hard for me to
begin to lose now. If I was to do what I want to
do, I'd say, 'Let's never give in.' But I know what's
best for the union, boys ... an' so I lose my first
strike."</p>

<p>He sank back into his seat, and his head fell
forward upon his breast. There was a moment of
sympathetic silence, then an outburst of shouts: "It
ain't your fault!" "You've done your best!"
"You take your lickin' like a man!" But these
individual shouts were straightway lost in cries of
"Foley!" "Foley!" and in a mighty cheer that
thundered through the hall. Next to a game fighter
men admire a game loser.</p>

<p>This was Tom's moment. He had been waiting
till Foley should place himself on record before the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
entire union. He now stood up and raised his right
hand to gain Connelly's attention. "Mr. Chairman!"
he called.</p>

<p>"Question!" "Question!" shouted the crowd,
few even noticing that Tom was claiming right of
speech.</p>

<p>"Mr. Chairman!" Tom cried again.</p>

<p>Connelly's attention was caught, and for an instant
he looked irresolutely at Tom. The crowd,
following their president's eyes, saw Tom and broke
into a great hiss.</p>

<p>"D'you want any more speeches?" Connelly put
to the union.</p>

<p>"No!" "No!" "Question!" "Question!"</p>

<p>"All in favor of the motion&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The desperate strait demanded an eminence to
speak from, but the way to the platform was blocked.
Tom vaulted to the top of the grand piano, and his
eyes blazed down upon the crowd.</p>

<p>"You shall listen to me!" he shouted, breaking
in on Connelly. His right arm pointed across the hall
to where Foley was bowed in humiliation. "Buck
Foley has sold you out!"</p>

<p>In the great din his voice did not carry more than
a dozen rows, but upon those rows silence fell suddenly.
"What was that?" men just behind asked
excitedly, their eyes on Tom standing on the piano,
his arm stretched toward Foley. A tide of explanation
moved backward, and the din sank before it.</p>

<p>Tom shouted again: "Buck Foley has sold you
out!"</p>

<p>This time his words reached the farthest man in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Pg 325]</a></span>
the hall. There was an instant of stupefied quiet.
Then Foley himself stood up. He seemed to have
paled a shade, but there was not a quaver in his voice
when he spoke.</p>

<p>"This's a nice little stage play our friend's made
up for the last minute. He's been fightin' a settlement
right along, an' this is his last trick to get youse
to put it off. He's sorter like a blind friend o' mine
who went fishin' one day. He got turned with his
back to the river, an' he fished all day in the grass.
I think Keating's got turned in the wrong direction,
too."</p>

<p>A few in the crowd laughed waveringly; some
began to talk excitedly; but most looked silently at
Tom, still stunned by his blow-like declaration.</p>

<p>Tom paid no attention to Foley's words. "Fifty
thousand dollars was what he got!" he said in his
loudest voice.</p>

<p>For the moment it was as if those fifteen hundred
men had been struck dumb and helpless. Again it
was Foley who broke the silence. He reared his
long body above the bewildered crowd and spoke
easily. "If youse boys don't see through that lie
youse're blind. If I was runnin' the strike alone an'
wanted to sell it out, what Keating's said might be
possible. But I ain't runnin' it. A committee is&mdash;five
men. Now how d'youse suppose I could sell out
with four men watchin' me&mdash;an' one o' them a
friend o' Keating?"</p>

<p>He did not wait for a response from his audience.
He turned to Connelly and went on with a provoked
air: "Mr. Chairman, youse know, an' the rest o'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Pg 326]</a></span>
the committee knows, that it was youse who suggested
we give up the strike. An' youse know I held out
again' givin' in. Now ain't we had enough o' Keating's
wind? S'pose youse put the question."</p>

<p>What Foley had said was convincing; and, even
at this instant, Tom himself could but admire the
self-control, the air of provoked forbearance, with
which he said it. The quiet, easy speech had given
the crowd time to recover. As Foley sat down there
was a sudden tumult of voices, and then loud cries of
"Question!" "Question!"</p>

<p>"Order, Mr. Chairman! I demand the right to
speak!" Tom cried.</p>

<p>"No one wants to hear you, and the question's
called for."</p>

<p>Tom turned to the crowd. "It's for you to say
whether you'll hear me or&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Out of order!" shouted Connelly.</p>

<p>"I've got facts, men! Facts! Will it hurt you
to hear me? You can vote as you please, then!"</p>

<p>"Question!" went up a roar, and immediately
after it a greater and increasing roar of "Keating!"
"Keating!"</p>

<p>Connelly could but yield. He pounded for order,
then nodded at Tom. "Well, go on."</p>

<p>Tom realized the theatricality of his position on
the piano, but he also realized its advantage, and did
not get down. He waited a moment to gain control
of his mind, and his eyes moved over the rows and
rows of faces that gleamed dully from sweat and
excitement through the haze of smoke.</p>

<p>What he had to say first was pure conjecture, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Pg 327]</a></span>
he spoke with the convincing decision of the man
who has guessed at nothing. "You've heard the
other men speak. All I ask of you is to hear me out
the same way. And I have something far more important
to say than anything that's been said here
to-night. I am going to tell you the story of the
most scoundrelly trick that was ever played on a
trade union. For the union has been sold out, and
Buck Foley lies when he says it has not, and he knows
he lies!"</p>

<p>Every man was listening intently. Tom went on:
"About three weeks ago, just when negotiations were
opened again, Foley arranged with the bosses to sell
out the strike. Fifty thousand dollars was the price.
The bosses were to make a million or more out of
the deal, Foley was to make fifty thousand, and we
boys were to pay for it all! Foley's work was to
fool the committee, make them lose confidence in the
strike, and they of course would make the union lose
confidence and we'd give up. That was his job, and
for it he was to have fifty thousand dollars.</p>

<p>"Well, he was the man for the job. He worked
the committee, and worked it so slick it never knew
it was being worked. He even made the committee
think it was urging him to give up the strike. How
he did it, it's beyond me or any other honest man
even to guess. No one could have done it but Foley.
He's the smoothest crook that ever happened. I
give you that credit, Buck Foley. You're the
smoothest crook that ever happened!"</p>

<p>Foley had come to his feet with a look that was
more of a glaring scowl than anything else: eyebrows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[Pg 328]</a></span>
drawn down shaggily, a gully between them&mdash;nose
drawn up and nostrils flaring&mdash;jaws clenched&mdash;the
whole face clenched. "Mr. President, are youse
goin' to let that man go on with his lies?" he broke
in fiercely.</p>

<p>The crowd roused from its tension. "Go on,
Keating! Go on!"</p>

<p>"If he goes on with them lies, I for one ain't goin'
to stay to listen to 'em!" Foley grabbed his coat
from the back of his chair and started to edge through
to the aisle.</p>

<p>"If you leave, Buck Foley, it's the same as a confession
of guilt!" shouted Tom. "Stay here and
defend yourself like a man, if you can!"</p>

<p>"Against youse?" He laughed a dry cackling
laugh, and his returning self-mastery smoothed out
his face. And then his inherent bravado showed
itself. On reaching the aisle, instead of turning
toward the door, he turned toward the platform and
seated himself on its edge, directing a look of
insouciant calm upon the men.</p>

<p>"Whatever lies there are, are all yours, Buck
Foley," Tom went on. He looked again at the
crowd, bending toward him in attention. "The
trick worked. How well is shown by our being on
the point of voting to give up the strike. Little by
little our confidence was destroyed by doubt, and
little by little Foley got nearer to his money&mdash;till
to-day came. I'm speaking facts now, boys. I've
got evidence for everything I'm going to tell you.
I know every move Foley's made in the last thirty-six
hours.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Pg 329]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, this morning,&mdash;I'll only give the big facts,
facts that count,&mdash;this morning he went to get the
price of us&mdash;fifty thousand dollars. Where do you
suppose he met Baxter? In some hotel, or some
secret place? Not much. Cunning! That word
don't do justice to Foley. He met Baxter in Baxter's
own office!&mdash;and with the door open! Could anything
be more in harmony with the smooth scheme
by which he fooled the committee? He left the door
wide open, so everyone outside could hear that
nothing crooked was going on. He swore at Baxter.
He called him every sort of name because he would
not make us any concession. After a minute or two
he came out, still swearing mad. His coat was buttoned
up&mdash;tight. It was unbuttoned when he went
in. And the people that heard thought what an
awful calling-down Baxter had got.</p>

<p>"Foley went first to the Independence Bank. He
left seventeen thousand there. At the Jackson Bank
he left fifteen thousand, and at the Third National
eighteen thousand. Fifty thousand dollars, boys&mdash;his
price for selling us out! And he comes here
to-night and pretends to be broken-hearted. 'This
is the hardest hour of my life,' he says; 'and so I
lose my first strike.' Broken-hearted!&mdash;with fifty
thousand put in the bank in one day!"</p>

<p>There was a tense immobility through all the
crowd, and a profound stillness, quickly broken by
Foley before anyone else could forestall him. There
was a chance that Tom's words had not caught hold&mdash;his
thousandth chance.</p>

<p>"If that fool is through ravin', better put the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Pg 330]</a></span>
motion, Connelly," he remarked the instant Tom
ended, in an even tone that reached the farthest edge
of the hall. No one looking at him at this instant,
still sitting on the edge of the platform, would have
guessed his show of calmness was calling from him
the supreme effort of his life.</p>

<p>Voices buzzed, then there rose a dull roar of anger.</p>

<p>It had been Foley's last chance, and he had lost.
He threw off his control, and leaped to his feet, his
face twisted with vengeful rage. He tossed his hat
and coat on the platform, and without a word made
a rush through the men toward Tom.</p>

<p>"Let him through, boys!" Tom shouted, and
sprang from the piano. Petersen stepped quickly to
his side, but Tom pushed him away and waited in
burning eagerness in the little open space. And the
crowd, still dazed by the revelations of the last scene,
looked fascinated upon this new one.</p>

<p>But at this moment an interruption came from the
rear of the hall. "Letter for Foley!" shouted a
voice. "Letter for Foley!"</p>

<p>Foley paused in his rush, and turned his livid face
toward the cry. The sergeant-at-arms was pushing
his way through the center aisle, repeating his shout,
his right hand holding an envelope aloft. He gained
Foley's side and laid the letter in the walking delegate's
hand. "Messenger just brought it! Very
important!" he cried.</p>

<p>Foley glared at Tom, looked at the letter, hesitated,
then ripped open the envelope with a bony
forefinger. The crowd looked on, hardly breathing,
while he read.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Pg 331]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">IN WHICH MR. BAXTER SHOWS HIMSELF
A MAN OF RESOURCES</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idci.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">It was just eight o'clock when Johnson
gave three excited raps with the heavy
iron knocker on the door of Mr. Baxter's
house in Madison Avenue. A personage
in purple evening clothes drew the door wide open,
but on seeing the sartorial character of the caller he
filled the doorway with his own immaculate figure.</p></div>

<p>"Is Mr. Baxter at home?" asked Johnson
eagerly.</p>

<p>"He is just going out," the other condescended to
reply.</p>

<p>That should have been enough to dispose of this
common fellow. But Johnson kept his place. "I
want to see him, for just a minute. Tell him my
name. He'll see me. It's Johnson."</p>

<p>The personage considered a space, then disappeared
to search for Mr. Baxter; first showing his
discretion by closing the door&mdash;with Johnson outside
of it. He quickly reappeared and led Johnson across
a hall that was as large as Johnson's flat, up a broad
stairway, and through a wide doorway into the
library, where he left him, standing, to gain what he
could from sight of the rows and rows of leather-backed
volumes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p>Almost at once Mr. Baxter entered, dressed in a
dinner coat.</p>

<p>"You have something to tell me?" he asked
quickly.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This way." Mr. Baxter led Johnson into a
smaller room, opening upon the library, furnished
with little else besides a flat-top walnut desk, a telephone,
and a typewriter on a low table. Here Mr.
Baxter sometimes attended to his correspondence,
with the assistance of a stenographer sent from the
office, when he did not feel like going downtown; and
in here, when the mood was on him, he sometimes
slipped to write bits of verse, a few of which he had
published in magazines under a pseudonym.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter closed the door, took the chair at the
desk and waved Johnson to the stenographer's. "I
have only a minute. What is it?"</p>

<p>For all his previous calls on Mr. Baxter, this
refined presence made Johnson dumb with embarrassment.
He would have been more at his ease had
he had the comfort of fumbling his hat, but the
purple personage had gingerly taken his battered
derby from him at the door.</p>

<p>"Well?" said Mr. Baxter, a bit impatiently.</p>

<p>Johnson found his voice and rapidly told of Tom's
discovery, as he had heard it from Tom twenty
minutes before, and of the exposure that was going
to be made that evening. At first Mr. Baxter seemed
to start; the hand on the desk did certainly tighten.
But that was all.</p>

<p>"Did Mr. Keating say, in this story he proposes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span>
to tell, whether we offered Mr. Foley money to sell
out, or whether Mr. Foley demanded it?" he asked,
when Johnson had ended.</p>

<p>"He didn't say. He didn't seem to know."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter did not speak for a little while; then
he said, with a quiet carelessness: "What you have
told me is of no great importance, though it probably
seems so to you. It might, however, have been of
great value. So I want to say to you that I thoroughly
appreciate the promptness with which you
have brought me this intelligence. If I can still
depend upon your faithfulness, and your secrecy&mdash;&mdash;"
Mr. Baxter paused.</p>

<p>"Always," said Johnson eagerly.</p>

<p>"And your secrecy&mdash;" this with a slight emphasis,
the gray eyes looking right through Johnson;
"you can count upon an early token of appreciation,
in excess of what regularly comes to
you."</p>

<p>"You've always found you could count on me,
ain't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And you always can!"</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter touched a button beneath his desk.
"Have Mitchell show Mr. Johnson out," he said
to the maid who answered the ring. "Do you know
where Mrs. Baxter is?"</p>

<p>"In her room, sir."</p>

<p>Johnson bowed awkwardly, and backed away after
the maid.</p>

<p>"Good-night," Mr. Baxter said shortly, and followed
the two out. He crossed the library with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Pg 334]</a></span>
intention of going to the room of his wife, who had
come to town to be with him during the crisis of the
expected victory, but he met her in the hall ready
to go out.</p>

<p>"My dear, some important business has just come
up," he said. "I'm afraid there's nothing for me
to do but to attend to it to-night."</p>

<p>"That's too bad! I don't care for myself, for
it's only one of those stupid musical comedies. I
only cared to go because I thought it would help
you through the suspense of the evening."</p>

<p>After the exchange of a few more words he kissed
her and she went quietly back to her room. He
watched her a moment, wondering if she would bear
herself with such calm grace if she knew what awaited
him in to-morrow's papers.</p>

<p>He passed quickly back into the little office, and
locked the door behind him. Then the composure
he had worn before Johnson and his wife swiftly
vanished; and he sat at the desk with interlocked
hands, facing the most critical situation of his life.
There was no doubting what Johnson had told
him.</p>

<p>When to-morrow's papers appeared with their certain
stories&mdash;first page, big headlines&mdash;of how he
and other members of the Executive Committee, all
gentlemen of reputation, had bribed a walking delegate,
and a notoriously corrupt walking delegate, to
sell out the Iron Workers' strike&mdash;the members of
the committee would be dishonored forever, and he
dishonored more than all. And his wife, how could
she bear this? How could he explain to her, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Pg 335]</a></span>
believed him nothing but honor, once this story was
out?</p>

<p>He forced these sickening thoughts from his
brain. He had no time for them. Disgrace must
be avoided, if possible, and every minute was of
honor's consequence. He strained his mind upon the
crisis. The strike was now nothing; of first importance,
of only importance, was how to escape disgrace.</p>

<p>It was the peculiar quality of Mr. Baxter's trained
mind that he saw, with almost instant directness, the
best chance in a business situation. Two days before
it had taken Tom from eleven to eleven, twelve hours,
to see his only chance. Mr. Baxter now saw his only
chance in less than twelve minutes.</p>

<p>His only chance was to forestall exposure, by being
the first to tell the story publicly. He saw his course
clearly&mdash;to rush straight to the District Attorney,
to tell a story almost identical with Tom's, and that
varied from the facts on only two points. First of
these two points, the District Attorney was to be told
that Foley had come to them demanding fifty thousand
dollars as the price of settlement. Second, that
they had seen in this demand a chance to get the
hands of the law upon this notorious walking delegate;
that they had gone into the plan with the sole
purpose of gaining evidence against him and bringing
him to justice; that they had been able to secure a
strong case of extortion against him, and now demanded
his arrest. This same story was to go to
the newspapers before they could possibly get Tom's.
The committee would then appear to the world in no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Pg 336]</a></span>
worse light than having stooped to the use of somewhat
doubtful means to rid themselves and the union
of a piratical blackmailer.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter glanced at his watch. It was half-past
eight. He stepped to the telephone, found the
number of the home telephone of the District Attorney,
and rang him up. He was in, luckily, and
soon had the receiver at his ear. Could Mr. Baxter
see him in half an hour on a matter of importance&mdash;of
great public importance? Mr. Baxter could.</p>

<p>He next rang up Mr. Murphy, who had been with
him in his office that morning when the money had
been handed to Foley. Mr. Murphy was also at
home, and answered the telephone himself. Could
Mr. Baxter meet him in fifteen minutes in the lobby
of the Waldorf-Astoria? Very important. Mr.
Murphy could.</p>

<p>As he left the telephone it struck him that while
the committee must seemingly make every effort to
secure Foley's arrest, it would be far better for them
if Foley escaped. If arrested, he would naturally
turn upon them and tell his side of the affair. Nobody
would believe him, for he was one against five,
but all the same he could start a most unpleasant
story.</p>

<p>One instant the danger flashed upon Mr. Baxter.
The next instant his plan for its avoidance was ready.
He seated himself at the typewriter, drew off its
black sole-leather case, ran in a sheet of plain white
paper, and, picking at the keys, slowly wrote a message
to Foley. That finished, he ran in a plain
envelope, which he addressed to Foley at Potomac<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Pg 337]</a></span>
Hall. This letter he would leave at the nearest
messenger office.</p>

<p>Five minutes later Mr. Baxter, in a business suit,
passed calmly through his front door, opened for him
by the purple personage, and out into the street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Pg 338]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="Chapter_XXX" id="Chapter_XXX"></a>Chapter XXX</h2>

<p class="chap">THE LAST OF BUCK FOLEY</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idct.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="T" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">The letter which Foley read, while the
union looked on, hardly breathing, was
as follows:</p></div>

<blockquote class="small ps"><p>All is over. The District Attorney will be told to-night you held
them up, forcing them to give you the amount you received. They
have all the evidence; you have none. Their hands are clean.
Against you it is a perfect case of extortion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Though the note was unsigned, Foley knew instantly
from whom it came. The contractors, then,
were going to try to clear themselves, and he was
to be made the scapegoat. He was to be arrested;
perhaps at once. Foley had thought over his situation
before, its possibilities and its dangers. His
mind worked quickly now. If he came to trial, they
had the witnesses as the note said&mdash;and he had none.
As they would be able to make it out, it would be a
plain case of extortion against him. He could not
escape conviction, and conviction meant years in Sing
Sing. Truly, all was over. He saw his only chance
in an instant&mdash;to escape.</p>

<p>The reading of the note, and this train of thought,
used less than a minute. Foley crushed the sheet of
paper and envelope into a ball and thrust them into
a trousers pocket, and looked up with the determina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Pg 339]</a></span>tion
to try his only chance. His eyes fell upon what
in the tense absorption of the minute he had almost
forgotten&mdash;fifteen hundred men staring at him with
fixed waiting faces, and one man staring at him with
clenched fists in vengeful readiness.</p>

<p>At sight of Tom his decision to escape was swept
out of him by an overmastering fury. He rushed
toward Tom through the alleyway the men had
automatically opened at Tom's command. But
Petersen stepped quickly out, a couple of paces ahead
of Tom, to meet him.</p>

<p>"Out o' the way, youse!" he snarled.</p>

<p>But Petersen did not get out of the way, and
before Tom could interfere to save the fight for
himself, Foley struck out savagely. Petersen gave
back a blow, just one, the blow that had gained the
fight for him a week ago. Foley went to the floor,
and lay there.</p>

<p>This flash of action released the crowd from the
spell that held them. They were roused from
statues to a mob. "Kill him! Kill him!" someone
shouted, and instantly the single cry swelled to a tremendous
roar.</p>

<p>Had it not been for Tom, Foley would have come
to his end then and there. The fifteen hundred men
started forward, crushing through aisles, upsetting
the folding chairs and tramping over their collapsed
frames, pushing and tearing at each other to get to
where Foley lay. Tom saw that in an instant the
front of that vindictive mob would be stamping the
limp body of the walking delegate into pulp. He
sprang to Foley's side, seized him by his collar and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Pg 340]</a></span>
dragged him forward into the space between the
piano and the end wall, so that the heavy instrument
was a breastwork against the union's fury.</p>

<p>"Here Petersen, Pete, the rest of you!" he cried.
The little group that had stood round him during
the meeting rushed forward. "In there!" He
pushed them, as a guard, into the gap before Foley's
body.</p>

<p>Then he faced about. The fore of that great
tumult of wrath was already pressing upon him and
the little guard, and the men behind were fighting
forward over chairs, over each other, swearing and
crying for Foley's death.</p>

<p>"Stop!" shouted Tom. Connelly, stricken with
helplessness, completely lost, pounded weakly with
his gavel.</p>

<p>"Kill him!" roared the mob. "Kill the traitor!"</p>

<p>"Disgrace the union by murder?" Tom shouted.
"Kill him?&mdash;what punishment is that? Nothing at
all! Let the law give him justice!"</p>

<p>The cries from the rear of the hall still went up,
but the half dozen men who had crowded, and been
crowded, upon the little guard now drew back, and
Tom thought his words were having their effect.
But a quick glance over his shoulder showed him Petersen,
in fighting posture&mdash;and he knew why the front
men had hesitated; and also showed him Foley
leaning dizzily against the piano.</p>

<p>The hesitation on the part of the front rank lasted
for but an instant. They were swept forward by
the hundreds behind them, and Foley's line of defenders
was crushed against the wall. It was all up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[Pg 341]</a></span>
with Foley, Tom thought; this onslaught would be
the last of him. And as his own body went against
the wall under the mob's terrific pressure, he had a
gasping wish that he had not interfered two minutes
before. The breath was all out of him, he thought
his ribs were going to crack, he was growing faint
and dizzy&mdash;when the pressure suddenly released and
the furious uproar hushed almost to stillness. He
regained his balance and his breath and glanced
dazedly about.</p>

<p>There, calmly standing on the piano and leaning
against the wall, was Foley, his left hand in his
trousers pocket, his right uplifted to command attention.</p>

<p>"Boys, I feel it sorter embarrassin' to interrupt
your little entertainment like this," he began blandly,
but breathing very heavily. "But I suppose I won't
have many more chances to make speeches before
youse, an' I want to make about a remark an' a half.
What's past&mdash;well, youse know. But what I got to
say about the future is all on the level. Go in an'
beat the contractors! Youse can beat 'em. An' beat
'em like hell!"</p>

<p>He paused, and gave an almost imperceptible
glance toward an open window a few feet away, and
moved a step nearer it. A look of baiting defiance
came over his face, and he went on: "As for youse
fellows. The whole crowd o' youse just tried to
do me up&mdash;a thousand or two again' one. I fooled
the whole bunch o' youse once. An' I can lick the
whole bunch o' youse, too!&mdash;one at a time. But
not just now!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Pg 342]</a></span></p>

<p>With his last word he sprang across to the sill of
the open window, five feet away. Tom had noted
Foley's glance and his edging toward the window,
and guessing that Foley contemplated some new
move, he had held himself in readiness for anything.
He sprang after Foley, thinking the walking delegate
meant to leap to his death on the stone-paved court
below, and threw his arms about the other's knees.
In the instant of embracing he noticed a fire-escape
landing across the narrow court, an easy jump&mdash;and
he knew that Foley had had no thought of
death.</p>

<p>As Tom jerked Foley from the window sill he
tripped over a chair and fell backward to the floor,
the walking delegate's body upon him. Foley was on
his feet in an instant, but Tom lay where he was with
the breath knocked out of him. He dimly heard the
union break again into cries; feet trampled him; he
felt a keen shooting pain. Then he was conscious
that some force was turning the edge of the mob from
its path; then he was lifted up and placed at the window
out of which he had just dragged Foley; and
then, Petersen's arm supporting him, he stood weakly
on one foot holding to the sill.</p>

<p>For an instant he had a glimpse of Foley, on the
platform, his back to the wall. During the minute
Tom had been on the floor a group of Foley's roughs,
moved by some strange reawakening of loyalty, had
rushed to his aid, but they had gone down; and now
Foley stood alone, behind a table, sneering at the
crowd.</p>

<p>"Come on!" he shouted, with something between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Pg 343]</a></span>
a snarl and a laugh, shaking his clenched fist. "Come
on, one at a time, an' I'll do up every one o' youse!"</p>

<p>The next instant he went down, and at the spot
where he sank the crowd swayed and writhed as the
vortex of a whirlpool. Tom, sickened, turned his
eyes away.</p>

<p>Turned them to see three policemen and two men
in plain clothes with badges on their lapels enter the
hall, stand an instant taking in the scene, and then
with drawn clubs plunge forward into the crowd.
The cry of "Police!" swept from the rear to the
front of the hall.</p>

<p>"We're after Foley!" shouted the foremost
officer, a huge fellow with a huge voice, by way of
explanation. "Get out o' the way!"</p>

<p>The last cry he repeated at every step. The crowd
pressed to either side, and the five men shouldered
slowly toward the vortex of the whirlpool. At length
they gained this fiercely swaying tangle of men.</p>

<p>"If youse kill that man, we'll arrest every one o'
youse for murder!" boomed the voice of the big
policeman.</p>

<p>The vortex became suddenly less violent. The five
officers pulled man after man back, and reached
Foley's body. He was lying on his side, almost
against the wall, eyes closed, mouth slightly gaping.
He did not move.</p>

<p>"Too late!" said the big policeman. "He's
dead!"</p>

<p>His words ran back through the crowd which had
so lusted for this very event. Stillness fell upon it.</p>

<p>The big policeman stooped and gently turned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Pg 344]</a></span>
long figure over and placed his hand above the heart.
The inner circle of the crowd looked on, waiting.
After a moment the policeman's head nodded.</p>

<p>"Beatin'?" asked one of the plain clothes men.</p>

<p>"Yes. But mighty weak."</p>

<p>"I'll be all right in a minute," said a faint voice.</p>

<p>The big policeman started and glanced at Foley's
face. The eyes were open, and looking at him.</p>

<p>"I s'pose youse're from Baxter?" the faint voice
continued.</p>

<p>"From the District Attorney."</p>

<p>"Yes." A whimsical lightness appeared in the
voice. "I been waitin' for youse. Lucky youse come
when youse did. A few minutes later an' youse might
not 'a' found me still waitin'."</p>

<p>He placed his hands beside him and weakly tried
to rise, but fell back with a little groan. The big
policeman and another officer helped him to his feet.
The big policeman tried to keep an arm round him for
support, but Foley pushed it away and leaned against
the wall, where he stood a moment gazing down on
the hundreds of faces. His shirt was ripped open
at the neck and down to the waist; one sleeve was
almost torn off; his vest was open and hung in two
halves from the back of his neck; coat he had not
had on. His face was beginning to swell, his lips
were bloody, and there was a dripping cut on his
forehead.</p>

<p>One of the plain clothes men drew out a pair of
handcuffs.</p>

<p>"Youse needn't put them on me," Foley said.
"I'll go with youse. Anyhow&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Pg 345]</a></span></p>

<p>He glanced down at his right hand. It was
swollen, and was turning purple.</p>

<p>The plain clothes man hesitated.</p>

<p>"Oh, he can't give us no trouble," said the big
policeman.</p>

<p>The handcuffs were pocketed.</p>

<p>"I'm ready," said Foley.</p>

<p>It was arranged that two of the uniformed men
were to lead the way out, the big policeman was to
come next with Foley, and the two plain clothes men
were to be the rearguard.</p>

<p>The big policeman placed an arm round Foley's
waist. "I better give youse a lift," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I ain't that weak!" returned Foley. "Come
on." He started off steadily. Certainly he had regained
strength in the last few minutes.</p>

<p>As the six men started a passage opened before
them. The little group of roughs who had come to
Foley's defense a few minutes before now fell in
behind.</p>

<p>Half-way to the door Foley stopped, and addressed
the crowd at large:</p>

<p>"Where's Keating?"</p>

<p>"Up by the piano," came the answer.</p>

<p>"Take me to him for a minute, won't youse?" he
asked of his guard.</p>

<p>They consulted, then turned back. Again a passage
opened and they marched to where Tom sat,
very pale, leaning against the piano. The crowd
pressed up, eager to get a glimpse of these two
enemies, now face to face for the last time.</p>

<p>"Look out, Tom!" a voice warned, as Foley, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Pg 346]</a></span>
the policeman at his side, stepped forth from his
guard.</p>

<p>"Oh, our fight's all over," said Foley. He paused
and gazed steadily down at Tom. None of those
looking on could have said there was any softness in
his face, yet few had ever before seen so little harshness
there.</p>

<p>"I don't know of a man that, an hour ago, I'd 'a'
rather put out o' business than youse, Keating," he at
length said quietly. "I don't love youse now. But
the real article is scarce, an' when I meet it&mdash;well, I
like to shake hands."</p>

<p>He held out his left hand. Tom looked hesitantly
up into the face of the man who had brought him to
fortune's lowest ebb&mdash;and who was now yet lower
himself. Then he laid his left hand in Foley's left.</p>

<p>Suddenly Foley leaned over and whispered in
Tom's ear. Then he straightened up. "Luck with
youse!" he said shortly and turned to his guards.
"Come on."</p>

<p>Again the crowd made way. Foley marched
through the passage, his head erect, meeting every
gaze unshrinkingly. The greater part of the crowd
looked on silently at the passing of their old leader,
now torn and bruised and bleeding, but as defiant as
in his best days. A few laughed and jeered and
flung toward him contemptuous words, but Foley
heeded them not, marching steadily on, looking into
every face.</p>

<p>At the door he paused, and with a lean, blood-trickled
smile of mockery, and of an indefinite something
else&mdash;perhaps regret?&mdash;gazed back for a mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Pg 347]</a></span>ment
on the men he had led for seven years. Then
he called out, "So-long, boys!" and waved his left
hand with an air that was both jaunty and sardonic.</p>

<p>He turned about, and wiping the red drops from
his face with his bare left hand, passed out of Potomac
Hall. Just behind him and his guard came the
little group of roughs, slipping covert glances among
themselves. And behind them the rest of the union
fell in; and the head of the procession led down the
broad stairway and forth into the street.</p>

<p>Then, without warning, there was a charge of the
roughs. The five officers were in an instant overwhelmed&mdash;tripped,
or overpowered and hurled to the
pavement&mdash;and the roughs swept on. The men behind
rushed forward, and without any such purpose
entangled the policemen among their numbers. It
was a minute or more before the five officers were free
and had their bearings, and could begin pursuit and
search.</p>

<p>But Buck Foley was not to be found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Pg 348]</a></span></p>

<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idci.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="I" title=""

<p class="cap_1">It was seven o'clock the next morning.
Tom lay propped up on the couch in his
sitting-room, his foot on a pillow, waiting
for Maggie to come back with the morning
papers. A minute before he had asked Ferdinand
to run down and get them for him, but Maggie, who
just then had been starting out for a loaf of bread,
had said shortly to the boy that she would get them
herself.</p></div>

<p>When Maggie had opened the door the night before,
while Petersen was clumsily trying to fit Tom's
key into the keyhole, the sight of Tom standing
against the wall on one foot, his clothes in disorder,
had been to her imagination a full explanation of
what had happened. Her face had hardened and
she had flung up her clenched hands in fierce helplessness.
"Oh, my God! So you've been at Foley again!"
she had burst out. "More trouble! My God, my
God! I can't stand it any longer!" She would have
gone on, but the presence of a third person had suddenly
checked her. She had stood unmoving in the
doorway, her eyes flashing, her breast rising and falling.
For an instant Tom, remembering a former
declaration, had expected her to close the door in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Pg 349]</a></span>
face, but with a gesture of infinite, rageful despair
she had stepped back from the door without a word,
and Petersen had supported him to the couch. Almost
immediately a doctor had appeared, for whom
Tom and Petersen had left a message on their way
home; and by the time the doctor and Petersen had
gone, leaving Tom in bed, her fury had solidified into
that obdurate, resentful silence which was the characteristic
second stage of her wrath. Her injustice had
roused Tom's antagonism, and thus far not a word
had passed between them.</p>

<p>The nearest newsstand was only a dozen steps from
the tenement's door, but minute after minute passed
and still Maggie did not return. After a quarter
hour's waiting Tom heard the hall door open and
close, and then Maggie came into the sitting-room.
He was startled at the change fifteen minutes had
made in her expression. The look of set hardness
was gone; the face was white and drawn, almost staring.
She dropped the papers on a chair beside the
couch. The top one, crumpled, explained the length
of her absence and her altered look.</p>

<p>Tom's heart began to beat wildly; she knew it
then! She paused beside him, and with his eyes down-turned
he waited for her to speak. Seconds passed.
He could see her hands straining, and hear her deep
breath coming and going. Suddenly she turned about
abruptly and went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Tom looked wonderingly after her a moment; then
his eyes were caught by a black line half across the
top of the crumpled paper: "Contractors Trap
Foley." He seized the paper and his eyes took in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Pg 350]</a></span>
the rest of the headline at a glance. "Arrested, But
Makes Spectacular Escape"; a dozen words about
the contractors' plan; and then at the very end, in
smallest display type: "Also Exposed in Union."
He quickly glanced through the headlines of the other
papers. In substance they were the same.</p>

<p>Utterly astounded, he raced through the several
accounts of Foley's exposure. They were practically
alike. They told of Mr. Baxter's visit to the District
Attorney, and then recited the events of the past three
weeks just as Mr. Baxter had given them to the
official prosecutor: How Foley had tried to hold the
Executive Committee up for fifty thousand dollars;
how the committee had seen in his demand a chance
to get him into the hands of the law, and so rid labor
and capital of a common enemy; how, after much
deliberation, they had decided to make the attempt;
how the sham negotiations had proceeded; how yesterday,
to make the evidence perfect, Foley had been
given the fifty thousand dollars he had demanded
as the price of settlement&mdash;altogether a most complete
and plausible story. "A perfect case," the District
Attorney had called it. Tom's part in the affair
was told in a couple of paragraphs under a subhead.</p>

<p>One of the papers had managed to get in a hurried
editorial on Mr. Baxter's story. "Perhaps their way
of trapping Foley smacks strongly of gum-shoe
detective methods," the editorial concluded; "but
their end, the exposure of a notorious labor brigand,
will in the mind of the public entirely justify their
means. They have earned the right to be called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Pg 351]</a></span>
public benefactors." Such in tone was the whole editorial.
It was a prophecy of the editorial praise that
was to be heaped upon the contractors in the afternoon
papers and those of the next morning.</p>

<p>Tom flung the papers from him in sickened, bewildered
wrath. He had expected a personal triumph
before the public. He felt there was something
wrong; he felt Mr. Baxter had robbed him of his
glory, just as Foley had robbed him of his strike.
But in the first dazedness of his disappointment he
could not understand. He hardly touched the breakfast
Maggie had quietly put upon the chair while he
had been reading, but sank back and, his eyes on the
ceiling with its circle of clustered grapes, began to go
over the situation.</p>

<p>At the end of a few minutes he was interrupted by
Ferdinand, whom Maggie had sent in with a letter
that had just been delivered by a messenger. Tom
took it mechanically, then eagerly tore open the
envelope. The letter was from the detective agency,
and its greater part was the report of the observations
made the previous evening by the detectives detailed
to watch Mr. Baxter. Tom read it through repeatedly.
It brought Foley's whispered words flashing
back upon him: "I give it to youse for what it's
worth; Baxter started this trick." He began slowly
to understand.</p>

<p>But before he had fully mastered the situation
there was a loud knock at the hall door. Maggie
opened it, and Tom heard a hearty voice sound out:
"Good-mornin', Mrs. Keating. How's your husband?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Pg 352]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll find him in the front room, Mrs. Barry,"
Maggie answered. "All of you go right in."</p>

<p>There was the sound of several feet, and then Mrs.
Barry came in and after her Barry and Pete. "Say,
Tom, I'm just tickled to death!" she cried, with a
smile of ruddy delight. She held out a stubby, pillowy
hand and shook Tom's till her black straw hat,
that the two preceding summers had done their best
to turn brown, was bobbing over one ear. "Every
rib I've got is laughin'. How're you feelin'?"</p>

<p>"First rate, except for my ankle. How're you,
boys?" He shook hands with Barry and Pete.</p>

<p>"Well, you want to lay still as a bed-slat for a
week or two. A sprain ain't nothin' to monkey with,
I tell you what. Mrs. Keating, you see't your
husband keeps still."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Maggie, setting chairs for the three
about the couch, and herself slipping into one at the
couch's foot.</p>

<p>Mrs. Barry sank back, breathing heavily, and
wiped her moist face. "I said to the men this
mornin' that I'd give 'em their breakfast, but I
wouldn't wash a dish till I'd been over to see you.
Tom, you've come out on top, all right! An' nobody's
gladder'n me. Unless, o' course, your wife."</p>

<p>Maggie gave a little nod, and her hands clasped
each other in her lap.</p>

<p>"It's easy to guess how proud you must be o' your
man!" Mrs. Barry's red face beamed with sympathetic
exultation.</p>

<p>Maggie gulped; her strained lips parted: "Of
course I'm proud."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Pg 353]</a></span></p>

<p>"I wish you could 'a' heard the boys last night,
Tom," cried Pete. "Are they for you? Well, I
should say! You'll be made walkin' delegate at the
very next meetin', sure."</p>

<p>"Well, I'd like to know what else they could do?"
Mrs. Barry demanded indignantly. "With him
havin' fought an' sacrificed as he has for 'em!"</p>

<p>"He can have anything he wants now. Tokens of
appreciation? They'll be givin' you a gold watch an'
chain for every pocket."</p>

<p>"But what'll they think after they've read the
papers?" asked Tom.</p>

<p>"I saw how the bosses' fairy story goes. But the
boys ain't kids, an' they ain't goin' to swallow all that
down. They'll think about the same as me, an' I
think them bosses ain't such holy guys as they say
they are. I think there was somethin' else we don't
know nothin' about, or else the bosses'd 'a' gone right
through with the game. An' the boys'll not give
credit to a boss when they can give credit to a union
man. You can bet your false teeth on that. Anyhow,
Tom, you could fall a big bunch o' miles an'
still be in heaven."</p>

<p>"Now, the strike, Tom; what d'you think about
the strike?" Mrs. Barry asked.</p>

<p>Before Tom could answer there was another knock.
Maggie slipped away and ushered in Petersen, who
hung back abashed at this gathering.</p>

<p>"Hello, Petersen," Tom called out. "Come in.
How are you?"</p>

<p>Petersen advanced into the room, took a chair and
sat holding his derby hat on his knees with both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Pg 354]</a></span>
hands. "I be purty good,&mdash;oh, yah," he answered,
smiling happily. "I be movin' to-day."</p>

<p>"Where?" Tom asked. "But you haven't met
Mrs. Barry, have you?"</p>

<p>"Glad to know you, Mr. Petersen." Mrs. Barry
held out her hand, and Petersen, without getting up,
took it in his great embarrassed fist.</p>

<p>She turned quickly about on Tom. "What d'you
think about the strike?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes, what about it?" echoed Barry and Pete.</p>

<p>"We're going to win it," Tom answered, with
quiet confidence.</p>

<p>"You think so?"</p>

<p>"I do. We're going to win&mdash;certain!"</p>

<p>"If you do, we women'll all take turns kissin' your
shoes."</p>

<p>"You'll be, all in a jump, the biggest labor leader
in New York City!" cried Pete. "What, to put
Buck Foley out o' business, an' to win a strike after
the union had give it up!"</p>

<p>Within Tom responded to this by a wild exultation,
but he maintained an outward calm. "Don't lay it
on so thick, Pete."</p>

<p>He stole a glance at Maggie. She was very pale.
Her eyes, coming up from her lap, met his. She rose
abruptly.</p>

<p>"I must see to my work," she said, and hurried
into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Tom's eyes came back to his friends. "Have you
boys heard anything about Foley?"</p>

<p>"He ain't been caught yet," answered Pete.</p>

<p>"He'll never be," Tom declared. Then after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Pg 355]</a></span>
moment's thought he went on with conviction:
"Boys, if Foley had had a fair start and had been
honest, he'd have been the biggest thing that ever
happened in the labor world."</p>

<p>Their loyalty prompted the others to take strong
exception to this.</p>

<p>"No, I wouldn't have been in his class," Tom
said decidedly, and led the talk to the probabilities of
the next few days. They chatted on for half an hour
longer, then all four departed. Pete, however, turned
at the door and came back.</p>

<p>"I almost forgot, Tom. There was something
else. O' course you didn't hear about Johnson. You
know there's been someone in the union&mdash;more'n one,
I bet&mdash;that's been keepin' the bosses posted on all
we do. Well, Johnson got himself outside o' more'n
a few last night, an' began to get in some lively jaw-work.
The boys got on from what he said that he'd
been doin' the spy business for a long time&mdash;that he'd
seen Baxter just before the meetin'. Well, a few
things happened right then an' there. I won't tell
you what, but I got an idea Johnson sorter thinks
this ain't just the health resort for his kind o' disease."</p>

<p>Tom said nothing. Here was confirmation of, and
addition to, one sentence in the detectives' report.</p>

<p>Pete had been gone hardly more than a minute
when he was back for the third time. "Say, Tom,
guess where Petersen's movin'?" he called out from
the dining-room door.</p>

<p>"I never can."</p>

<p>"On the floor above! A wagon load o' new
furniture just pulled up down in front. I met Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Pg 356]</a></span>sen
an' his wife comin' in. Petersen was carryin' a
bran' new baby carriage."</p>

<p>Pete's news had immediate corroboration. As he
was going out Tom heard a thin voice ask, "Is Mr.
Keating in?" and heard Maggie answer, "Go right
through the next door;" and there was Mrs. Petersen,
her child in her arms, coming radiantly toward
him.</p>

<p>"Bless you, brother!" she said. "I've heard all
about your glorious victory. I could hardly wait to
come over an' tell you how glad I am. I'd 'a' come
with Nels, but I wasn't ready an' he had to hurry
here to be ready to look after the furniture when it
come. I'm so glad! But things had to come out that
way. The Lord never lets sin prevail!&mdash;praise His
name!"</p>

<p>"Won't you sit down, Mrs. Petersen?" Tom said,
in some embarrassment, relinquishing the slight hand
she had given him.</p>

<p>"I can't stop a minute, we're so busy. You must
come up an' see us. I pray God'll prosper you in
your new work, an' make you a power for right.
Good-by."</p>

<p>As she passed through the dining-room Tom heard
her thin vibrant voice sound out again: "You ought
to be the proudest an' happiest woman in America,
Mrs. Keating." There was no answer, and Tom
heard the door close.</p>

<p>In a few minutes Maggie came in and stood leaning
against the back of one of the chairs. "Tom,"
she said; and her voice was forced and unnatural.</p>

<p>Tom knew that the scene he had been expecting so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Pg 357]</a></span>
long was now at hand. "Yes," he answered, in a
kind of triumphant dread.</p>

<p>She did not speak at once, but stood looking down
on him, her throat pulsing, her face puckered in its
effort to be immobile. "Well, it was about time
something of this sort was happening. You know
what I've had to put up with in the last five months.
I suppose you think I ought to beg your pardon.
But you know what I said, I said because I thought it
was to our interest to do that. And you know if we'd
done what I said we'd never have seen the hard times
we have."</p>

<p>"I suppose not," Tom admitted, with a dull sinking
of his heart.</p>

<p>She stood looking down on him for a moment
longer, then turned abruptly about and went into the
kitchen. These five sentences were her only verbal
acknowledgment that she had been wrong, and her
only verbal apology. She felt much more than this&mdash;grudgingly,
she was proud that he had succeeded,
she was proud that others praised him, she was
pleased at the prospect of better times&mdash;but more
than this she could not bend to admit.</p>

<p>While Tom lay on the couch reasoning himself
into a fuller and fuller understanding of Mr. Baxter's
part in last night's events, out in the kitchen Maggie's
resentment over having been proved wrong was
slowly disappearing under the genial influence of
thoughts of the better days ahead. Her mind ran
with eagerness over the many things that could be
done with the thirty-five dollars a week Tom would
get as walking delegate&mdash;new dresses, better than she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Pg 358]</a></span>
had ever had before; new things for the house; a better
table. And she thought of the social elevation
Tom's new importance in the union would give her.
She forgot her bitterness. She became satisfied; then
exultant; then, unconsciously, she began humming.</p>

<p>Presently her new pride had an unexpected gratification.
In the midst of her dreams there was a
rapping at the hall door. Opening it she found before
her a man she had seen only once&mdash;Tom had pointed
him out to her one Sunday when they had walked on
Fifth Avenue&mdash;but she recognized him immediately.</p>

<p>"Is Mr. Keating at home?" the man asked.</p>

<p>"Yes." Maggie, awed and embarrassed, led the
way into the sitting-room.</p>

<p>"Mr. Keating," said the man, in a quiet, even
voice.</p>

<p>"Mr. Baxter!" Tom ejaculated.</p>

<p>"I saw in the papers this morning that you were
hurt. Thank you very much, Mrs. Keating." He
closed the door after Maggie had withdrawn, as
though paying her a courtesy by the act, and sat
down in the chair she had pushed beside the couch for
him. "Your injury is not serious, I hope."</p>

<p>Tom regarded the contractor with open amazement.
"No," he managed to say. "It will keep me
in the house for a while, though."</p>

<p>"I thought so, and that's why I came. I saw from
the papers that you would doubtless be the next
leader of the union. As you know, it is highly important
to both sides that we come to an agreement about
the strike as early as possible. It seemed to me
desirable that you and I have a chat first and arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[Pg 359]</a></span>
for a meeting of our respective committees. And
since I knew you could not come to see me, I have
come to see you."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter delivered these prepared sentences
smoothly, showing his white teeth in a slight smile.
This was the most plausible reason his brain had been
able to lay hold of to explain his coming. And come
he must, for he had a terrifying dread that Tom knew
the facts he was trying to keep from the public. It
had taxed his ingenuity frightfully that morning to
make an explanation to his wife that would clear himself.
If Tom did know, and were to speak&mdash;there
would be public disgrace, and no explaining to his
wife.</p>

<p>Tom's control came back to him, and he was filled
with a sudden exultant sense of mastery over this
keen, powerful man. "It is of course desirable that
we settle the strike as soon as possible," he agreed
calmly, not revealing that he recognized Mr. Baxter's
explanation to be a fraud.</p>

<p>"It certainly will be a relief to us to deal with a
man of integrity. I think we have both had not very
agreeable experiences with one whose strong point
was not his honor."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>There was that in Mr. Baxter's manner which was
very near frank cordiality. "Has it not occurred to
you as somewhat remarkable, Mr. Keating, that both
of us, acting independently, have been working to
expose Mr. Foley?"</p>

<p>Tom had never had the patience necessary to beat
long about the bush. He was master, and he swept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[Pg 360]</a></span>
Mr. Baxter's method aside. "The sad feature of
both our efforts," he said calmly, but with fierce joy,
"has been that we have failed, so far, to expose the
chief villain."</p>

<p>The corners of Mr. Baxter's mouth twitched the
least trifle, but when he spoke he showed the proper
surprise. "Have we, indeed! Whom do you
mean?"</p>

<p>Tom looked him straight in the eyes. "I wonder
if you'd care to know what I think of you?"</p>

<p>"That's an unusual question. But&mdash;it might be
interesting."</p>

<p>"I think you are an infernal hypocrite!&mdash;and a
villain to boot!"</p>

<p>"What?" Mr. Baxter sprang to his feet, trying
to look angry and amazed.</p>

<p>"Sit down, Mr. Baxter," Tom said quietly.
"That don't work with me. I'm on to you. We got
Foley, but you're the man we've failed to expose&mdash;so
far."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter resumed his chair, and for an instant
looked with piercing steadiness at Tom's square
face.</p>

<p>"What do you know?&mdash;think you know?"</p>

<p>"I'll tell you, be glad to, for I want you to know
I'm thoroughly on to you. You suggested this scheme
to Foley, and it wasn't a scheme to catch Foley, but to
cheat the union." And Tom went on to outline the
parts of the story Mr. Baxter had withheld from the
newspapers.</p>

<p>"That sounds very interesting, Mr. Keating," Mr.
Baxter said, his lips trembling back from his teeth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[Pg 361]</a></span>
"But even supposing that were true, it isn't evidence."</p>

<p>"I didn't say it was&mdash;though part of it is. But
suppose I gave to the papers what I've said to you?
Suppose I made this point: if Baxter had really intended
to trap Foley, wouldn't he have had him
arrested the minute after the money had been turned
over, so that he would have stood in no danger of losing
the money, and so Foley would have been caught
with the goods on? And suppose I presented these
facts: Mr. Baxter had tickets bought for 'The Maid
of Mexico,' and was on the point of leaving for the
theater with his wife when a union man, his spy, who
had learned of my plan to expose the scheme, came
to his house and told him I was on to the game and
was going to expose it. Mr. Baxter suddenly decides
not to go to the theater, and rushes off to the District
Attorney with his story of having trapped Foley.
Suppose I said these things to the papers&mdash;they'd be
glad to get 'em, for it's as good a story as the one this
morning&mdash;what'd people be saying about you to-morrow?
They'd say this: Up to the time he heard from
his spy Baxter had no idea of going to the District
Attorney. He was in the game for all it was worth,
and only went to the District Attorney when he saw
it was his only chance to save himself. They'd size
you up for what you are&mdash;a briber and a liar!"</p>

<p>A faint tinge of color showed in Mr. Baxter's
white cheeks. "I see you're a grafter, too!" he said,
yielding to an uncontrollable desire to strike back.
"Well&mdash;what's <i>your</i> price?"</p>

<p>Tom sat bolt upright and glared at the contractor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[Pg 362]</a></span></p>

<p>"Damn you!" he burst out. "If it wasn't for this
ankle, I'd kick you out of the room, and down to the
street, a kick to every step! Now you get out of here!&mdash;and
quick!"</p>

<p>"I'm always glad to leave the presence of a
blackmailer, my dear sir." Mr. Baxter turned with a
bow and went out.</p>

<p>Tom, in a fury, swung his feet off the couch and
started to rise, only to sink back with a groan.</p>

<p>At the door of the flat Mr. Baxter thought of the
morrow, of what the public would say, of what his
wife would say. He came back, closed the door, and
stood looking steadily down on Tom. "Well&mdash;what
are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>"Give it to the papers, that's what!"</p>

<p>"Suppose you do, and suppose a few persons believe
it. Suppose, even, people say what you think
they will. What then? You will have given your&mdash;ah&mdash;your
information away, and how much better
off are you for it?"</p>

<p>"Blackmailer, did you call me!"</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter did not heed the exclamation, but continued
to look steadily downward, waiting.</p>

<p>A little while before Tom had been thinking
vaguely of the possible use he could make of his
power over Mr. Baxter. With lowered gaze, he
now thought clearly, rapidly. The moral element of
the situation did not appeal to him as strongly at that
moment as did the practical. If he exposed Mr. Baxter
it would bring himself great credit and prominence,
but what material benefit would that exposure
bring the union? Very little. Would it be right then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[Pg 363]</a></span>
for him, the actual head of the union, to use an advantage
for his self-glorification that could be turned to
the profit of the whole union?</p>

<p>After a minute Tom looked up. "No, I shall not
give this to the newspapers. I'm going to use it
otherwise&mdash;as a lever to get from you bosses what
belongs to us. I hate to dirty my hands by using such
means; but in fighting men of your sort we've got to
take every advantage we get. If I had a thief by the
throat I'd hardly let go so we could fight fair. I
wouldn't be doing the square thing by the union if I
refused to use an advantage of this sort."</p>

<p>He paused an instant and looked squarely into Mr.
Baxter's eyes. "Yes, I have a price, and here it is.
We're going to win this strike. You understand?"</p>

<p>"I think I do."</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You are very modest in your demands,"&mdash;sarcastically.
Tom did not heed the remark.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter half closed his eyes and thought a
moment. "What guarantee have I of your silence?"</p>

<p>"My word."</p>

<p>"Nothing else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing else."</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter was again silent for a thoughtful
moment.</p>

<p>"Well?" Tom demanded.</p>

<p>Mr. Baxter's face gave a faint suggestion that a
struggle was going on within. Then his little smile
came out, and he said:</p>

<p>"Permit me to be the first to congratulate you, Mr.
Keating, on having won the strike."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[Pg 364]</a></span></p>

<p class="chap">THE THORN OF THE ROSE</p>
<div class="drop">

<img src="images/idcs.jpg" width="100" height="100" alt="S" title=""
class="cap" />

<p class="cap_1">Shortly after lunch Mr. Driscoll called
Ruth into his office. "Dr. Hall has just
sent me word that he wants to meet the
building committee on important business
this afternoon, so if you'll get ready we'll start right
off."</p></div>

<p>A few minutes later the two were on a north-bound
Broadway car. Presently Mr. Driscoll blinked his
bulging eyes thoughtfully at his watch. "I want to
run in and see Keating a minute sometime this afternoon,"
he remarked. "He's just been doing some
great work, Miss Arnold. If we hurry we've got
time to crowd it in now." A pudgy forefinger went
up into the air. "Oh, conductor&mdash;let us off here!"</p>

<p>Before Ruth had recovered the power to object
they were out of the car and walking westward
through a narrow cross street. Her first frantic impulse
was to make some hurried excuse and turn
back. She could not face him again!&mdash;and in his
own home!&mdash;never! But a sudden fear restrained
this impulse: to follow it might reveal to Mr. Driscoll
the real state of affairs, or at least rouse his suspicions.
She had to go; there was nothing else she could do.
And so she walked on beside her employer, all her
soul pulsing and throbbing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[Pg 365]</a></span></p>

<p>Soon a change began to work within her&mdash;the
reassertion of her love. She would have avoided the
meeting if she could, but now fate was forcing her
into it. She abandoned herself to fate's irresistible
arrangement. A wild, excruciating joy began to possess
her. She was going to see him again!</p>

<p>But in the last minute there came a choking revulsion
of feeling. She could not go up&mdash;she could not
face him. Her mind, as though it had been working
all the time beneath her consciousness, presented her
instantly with a natural plan of avoiding the meeting.
She paused at the stoop of Tom's tenement. "I'll
wait here till you come down, or walk about the
block," she said.</p>

<p>"All right; I'll be gone only a few minutes," returned
the unobservant Mr. Driscoll. He mounted
the stoop, but drew aside at the door to let a woman
with a boy come out, then entered. Ruth's glance
rested upon the woman and child, and she instinctively
guessed who they were, and her conjecture was
instantly made certain knowledge by a voice from a
window addressing the woman as Mrs. Keating.
She gripped the iron hand-rail and, swaying, stared
at Maggie as she stood chatting on the top step. Her
fixed eyes photographed the cheap beauty of Maggie's
face, and her supreme insight, the gift of the
moment, took the likeness of Maggie's soul. She
gazed at Maggie with tense, white face, lips parted,
hardly breathing, all wildness within, till Maggie
started to turn from her neighbor. Then she herself
turned about and walked dizzily away.</p>

<p>In the meantime Mr. Driscoll had gained Tom's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[Pg 366]</a></span>
flat and was knocking on the door. When Maggie
had gone out&mdash;the silent accusation of Tom's presence
irked her so, she was glad to escape it for an hour
or two&mdash;she had left the door unlocked that Tom
might have no trouble in admitting possible callers.
Mr. Driscoll entered in response to Tom's "Come
in," and crossed heavily into the sitting-room.
"Hello there! How are you?" he called out, taking
Tom's hand in a hearty grasp.</p>

<p>"Why, Mr. Driscoll!" Tom exclaimed, with a
smile of pleasure.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll sank with a gasp into a chair beside
the couch. "Well, I suppose you think you're about
everybody," he said with a genial glare. "Of course
you think I ought to congratulate you. Well, I
might as well, since that's one thing I came here for.
I do congratulate you, and I mean it."</p>

<p>He again grasped Tom's hand. "I've been thinking
of the time, about five months ago, when you
stood in my office and called me a coward and a few
other nice things, and said you were going to put
Foley out of business. I didn't think you could
do it. But you have! You've done a mighty big
thing."</p>

<p>He checked himself, but his discretion was not
strong enough to force him to complete silence, nor
to keep a faint suggestion of mystery out of his manner.
"And you deserve a lot more credit than you're
getting. You've done a lot more than people think
you have&mdash;than you yourself think you have. If
you knew what I know&mdash;&mdash;!"</p>

<p>He nodded his head, with one eye closed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[Pg 367]</a></span>
"There's some people I'd back any day to beat the
devil. Well, well! And so you're to be walking delegate,
hey? That's what I hear."</p>

<p>"I understand the boys are talking about electing
me."</p>

<p>"Well, if you come around trying to graft off me,
or calling strikes on my jobs, there'll be trouble&mdash;I
tell you that."</p>

<p>"I'll make you an exception. I'll not graft off you,
and I'll let you work scabs and work 'em twenty-four
hours a day, if you want to."</p>

<p>"I know how!" Mr. Driscoll mopped his face
again. "I came around here, Keating, to say about
three things to you. I wanted to congratulate you,
and that I've done. And I wanted to tell you the
latest in the Avon affair. I heard just before I left
the office that those thugs of Foley's, hearing that
he'd skipped and left 'em in the lurch, had confessed
that you didn't have a thing to do with the Avon explosion&mdash;that
Foley'd put them up to it, and so on.
It'll be in the papers this afternoon. Even if your
case comes to trial, you'll be discharged in a minute.
The other thing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Mr. Driscoll&mdash;&mdash;" Tom began gratefully.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll saw what was coming, and rushed
on at full speed. "The other thing is this: I'm
speaking serious now, and just as your father might,
and it's for your own good, and nothing else. What
I've got to say is, get out of the union. You're too
good for it. A man's got to do the best he can for
himself in this world; it's his duty to make a place
for himself. And what are you doing for yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[Pg 368]</a></span>
in the union? Nothing. They've turned you down,
and turned you down hard, in the last few months.
It's all hip-hip-hurrah for you to-day, but they'll turn
you down again just as soon as they get a chance.
Mark what I say! Now here's the thing for you to
do. You can get out of the union now with glory.
Get out, and take the job I offered you five months
ago. Or a better one, if you want it."</p>

<p>"I can't tell you how much I thank you, Mr. Driscoll,"
said Tom. "But that's all been settled before.
I can't."</p>

<p>"Now you see here!"&mdash;and Mr. Driscoll leaned
forward and with the help of a gesticulating fist
launched into an emphatic presentation of "an old
man's advice" on the subject of looking out for
number one.</p>

<p>While he had been talking Ruth had walked about
the block in dazing pain, and now she had been
brought back to the tenement door by the combined
strength of love and duty. During the last two weeks
she had often wished that she might speak a moment
with Tom, to efface the impression she had given
him on that tragic evening when they had been last
together, that knowing him could mean to her only
great pain. That she should tell him otherwise, that
she should yield him the forgiveness she had withheld,
had assumed to her the seriousness of a great debt she
must discharge. The present was her best chance&mdash;perhaps
she could see him for a moment alone. And
so, duty justifying love, she entered the tenement and
mounted the stairs.</p>

<p>Tom's "Come in!" answered her knock. Clutch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[Pg 369]</a></span>ing
her self-control in both her hands, she entered.
At sight of her Tom rose upon his elbow, then
sank back, as pale as she, his fingers turned into his
palms.</p>

<p>"Mr. Keating," she said, with the slightest of
bows, and lowered herself into a chair by the door.</p>

<p>He could merely incline his head.</p>

<p>"You got tired waiting, did you," said Mr. Driscoll,
who had turned his short-sighted eyes about at
her entrance. "I'll be through in just a minute."
He looked back at Tom, and could but notice the
latter's white, set face. "Why, what's the matter?"</p>

<p>"I twisted my ankle a bit; it's nothing," Tom
answered.</p>

<p>Mr. Driscoll went on with his discourse, to ears
that now heard not a word. Ruth glanced about the
room. The high-colored sentimental pictures, the
cheap showy furniture, the ornaments on the mantelpiece&mdash;all
that she saw corroborated the revelation
she had had of Maggie's character. Inspiration in
neither wife nor home. Thus he had to live, who
needed inspiration&mdash;whom inspiration and sympathy
would help develop to a fitness for great ends. Thus
he had to live!&mdash;dwarfed!</p>

<p>She filled with frantic rebellion in his behalf.
Surely it did not have to be so, always. Surely the
home could be changed, the wife roused to sympathy&mdash;a
little&mdash;at least a little!... There must be
a way! Yes, yes; surely. There must be a way!...
Later, somehow, she would find it....</p>

<p>In this moment of upheaving ideas and emotions
she had the first vague stirring of a new purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[Pg 370]</a></span>&mdash;the
very earliest conception of the part she was to
play in the future, the part of an unseen and unrecognized
influence. She was brought out of her
chaotic thoughts by Mr. Driscoll rising from his chair
and saying: "There's no turning a fool from his
folly, I suppose. Well, we'd better be going, Miss
Arnold."</p>

<p>She rose, too. Her eyes and Tom's met. He
wondered, choking, if she would speak to him.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Mr. Keating," she said&mdash;and that was
all.</p>

<p>"Good-by, Miss Arnold."</p>

<p>With a great sinking, as though all were going
from beneath him, he watched her go out ...
heard the outer door close ... and lay exhausted,
gazing wide-eyed at the door frame in which he had
last seen her.</p>

<p>A minute passed so, and then his eyes, falling, saw
a pair of gray silk gloves on the table just before
him. They were hers. He had risen upon his elbow
with the purpose of getting to the table, by help of a
chair back, and securing them, when he heard the
hall door open gently and close. He sank back upon
the couch.</p>

<p>The next minute he saw her in the doorway again,
pale and with a composure that was the balance between
paroxysm and supreme repression. She paused
there, one hand against the frame, and then walked
up to the little table. "I came back for my gloves,"
she said, picking them up.</p>

<p>"Yes," his lips whispered, his eyes fastened on
her white face.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[Pg 371]</a></span></p>

<p>But she did not go. She stood looking down upon
him, one hand resting on the table, the other on a
chair back. "I left my gloves on purpose; there is
something I want to say to you," she said, with her
tense calm. "You remember&mdash;when I saw you last&mdash;I
practically said that knowing you could in the future
mean nothing to me but pain. I do not feel so now.
Knowing you has given me inspiration. There is
nothing for me to forgive&mdash;but if it means anything
to you ... I forgive you."</p>

<p>Tom could only hold his eyes on her pale face.</p>

<p>"And I want to congratulate you," she went on.
"I know how another is getting the praise that
belongs to you. I know how much more you deserve
than is being given you."</p>

<p>"Chance helped me much&mdash;at the end."</p>

<p>"It is the man who is always striving that is ready
for the chance when it comes," she returned.</p>

<p>Tom, lying back, gazing fixedly up into her dark
eyes, could not gather hold of a word. The gilded
clock counted off several seconds.</p>

<p>"Mr. Driscoll is waiting for me," she said, in a
voice that was weaker and less forcedly steady. She
had not changed her position all the time she had
spoken. Her arms now dropped to her side, and she
moved back ever so little.</p>

<p>"I hope ... you'll be happy ... always,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Yes ... and I hope you...."</p>

<p>"Good-by."</p>

<p>"Good-by."</p>

<p>Their eyes held steadfastly to each other for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[Pg 372]</a></span>
moment; she seemed to waver, and she caught the
back of a chair; then she turned and went out....</p>

<p>For long he watched the door out of which she
had gone; then, heedless of the pain, he rolled over
and stared at one great poppy in the back of the
couch.</p>
